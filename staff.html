Support doesn&#x27;t just answer questions and point users to documentation. Great support is personal and shows a genuine interest in helping users learn while being efficient, concise, and honest. Being a friend and a mentor to our users is important. Be sure to make them feel valued and absolutely do not make them feel dumb. Everyone has to start somewhere.</em><br><br><em>The primary source of support at P2PU is the helpdesk (</em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;help&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x29;"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.p2pu.org)</em></a><em>, but it&#x27;s not the only place. We provide support pro-actively, wherever our users need it. Maybe it&#x27;s in the comments of a blog post about P2PU, on Twitter, in a forum, or even in person at a conference. The important thing to know is that users don&#x27;t necessarily ask for help when they get stuck. Be on the lookout and offer to help you think someone needs it. For every person that asks for help you can bet that there are more people with the same problem who can&#x27;t be bothered to contact us.</em><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Knowledge Base - Strategy for expanding content<ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;help&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;kb">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.p2pu.org&#x2F;kb</a></li><li>When questions are asked over and over again, we should look at creating Knowledge Base responses for them +1 will start checking for it</li><li>Ali -&gt; happy to highlight areas that need to be fleshed out</li><li>Not much on development (maybe just link to github - i think there is good documentation there, we want the developers on github anyway)</li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;padsearch&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;padsearch.p2pu.org&#x2F;</a></li></ul><br>P2PU local staff meet-up in London<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp is at OCWC conference, will come to London&nbsp;</li><li>John is coming from Warsaw</li><li>Bekka and Chloe are in London</li><li>Nadeem will come from Birmingham</li><li>Perfect -&gt; APRIL 18 is first big launch! <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;rounds">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;rounds</a></li><li>Airplane banner (Chloe<s>Bekka</s> to organize)</li></ul><br>School of Webcraft<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Needs data for NSF grant application</li><li>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEN WAS IT LAUNCHED?<ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;02&#x2F;p2pu&#x2d;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;webcraft&#x2d;launches&#x2d;true&#x2d;awesomeness&#x2d;ensues&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.p2pu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;02&#x2F;p2pu-school-of-webcraft-launches-true-awesomeness-ensues&#x2F;</a></li><li>John: (started work) february 2010</li></ul></li><li>HOW MANY have enrolled till now?</li><li>Any other impressive numbers?i.e. # of comments</li><li>How many users enrolled in last years badge pilot?</li><li>Following up on this by email</li></ul><br>Hiring Update<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp will dig through a long list of draft contracts on the weekend</li><li>Full time developer, made an offer and accepted - starts 1 April 2012</li></ul><br>Group &#x2F; Course &#x2F; Challenge + Cohorts Problem and Idea for a Solution<br><ul class="bullet"><li>John has been thinking about this a lot, and struggling to come up with a solution to this problem</li><li>Q: Should we do away with courses?
