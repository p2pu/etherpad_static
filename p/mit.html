So how do we measure that???<br>just like time and space...... well in my opinion certain feelings rather than words possess&nbsp; .. POWER... fear being one that we as a society or earth on earth give a lot of POWER to or should I say it has been created FEAR and we<br>feed it or feed off of it to the point of what we recognize as a mental illness when we physically act out where people notice you don&#x27;t blend in.. .. .. .. .<br>.......... then more pointing fingures and confusion with large manuals and guidelines.. not even guidelines... blah blah blah to pretend we can shove down our throats to prevent us from actually following through as the<br>&quot;Definition&quot; at the right time of the era or place that defines a true artist??? so no matter what the person that can BLAHHH LOUDER WINS... And turned or created Not so good feelings ... that<br>for now who even knows at this point started out with an idea from someone else that turned or grew into something big for another person and got caught up by who deserves credit or money or fame, popularity..<br>but something we didnt have that someone else had.. well in the eyes someones that we had to strive or put Negative or Evil not good vibes out in the world to try and gain ??? that missing piece..<br>which turns into what IS and ISNT FAIR and more debate comes of it and that is something that people struggle with agreeing to even disagree?? well whoever had the &quot;power&quot; at the time of creating a widespread illusion that became the measurement for FAIR... could have been an act of acting out and not blending in but having the power to engrave it to a library in SOme building I will never get to Or wont find by wasting what could have been my creative energy on finding to pay more money ? get attention, make sure someone else doesnt reiceve or obtain that goal they so desire to find BLAH BLAH BLAH records of who said what to make a point....<br>If someone was really turning something I had created into my definition of CRAP and would really try to cause harm to me ,personally, by wasting their What could of been more creative energy to&nbsp; their creation of my &quot;spark&quot; ...<br>Thats on them, they have to feel what they are going to feel... weather I reacted in a way that would just be creating, feeding that &quot;Nasty&quot; energy.. and NO ONE can ever BLAME&#x2F;point fingers and be right... Even By you feeling guilty about the thats on them attitude not careing or at least trying not too ... in some way... non existent time is going to happen no matter how much pain and suffering runs its course on earth.. Why cant we sear it into another direction???<br>something not so predictable anyway... hey who says you shouldnt try and make a profit?? hey who says that profit has to be bad if your obtaining money?? why put standards and limitations... stupid rules that last... on anything...<br>So.. I say you want it that bad .. yes keep a library of records... you have to or end up paying for in the end with someones &quot;taxpayers&quot; money&nbsp; just to keep that building in the middle of a city of files COPYRIGHT Files with names and owners and who gave it to who documents of PAPER that is just going to be illegal And Burnt up with another illusion of laws that Books are illegal and must be burned at approximately Fahrenheit 451 degrees.... oh no.. and now I can only hope that I dont gain something for suggesting just another COPYRIGHT symbol stamped work of art I heard in their book... wait a minute now it makes sence! ..thats why book are going to have to be illegal! .. So we<br>Can Never Ever Steal someones quotes right out of a book ! hey that takes of the problem.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thats were i stop my flow of thought<br><br></body>
