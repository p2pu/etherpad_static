<body><strong>BODY&#x2F;CONNECTIONS</strong><br><br>Maybe one or two sentences per each, use paraphrases instead of block quotes, get the one sent<br><br>This draws on the notes at <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;metameso&#x2e;org&#x2F;&#x7e;joe&#x2F;body&#x2d;connections&#x2e;html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;metameso.org&#x2F;~joe&#x2F;body-connections.html</a><br><br>The first point of connection is to andragogy, Malcom Knowles&#x27;s theory&#x2F;practice of adult education.&nbsp; In succinct form, Knowles&#x27;s five&nbsp; principles of andragogy are as follows: (1) that adult learners are&nbsp; self-directed; (2) that they bring a wealth of experience to the&nbsp; educational setting; (3) that they enter educational settings ready to&nbsp; learn; (4) that they are problem-centered in their learning; and (5) that they are best motivated by internal factors. (squish and&#x2F;or move to previous section) Blondy points out both uses and challenges to each of Knowles principles of&nbsp; andragogy. For example, &quot;Cheren stated that while learners may express a&nbsp; desire to be self-directed in their learning, most lack the required understanding of learning necessary to be self-directed and thus need&nbsp; guidance and encouragement in the learning process.&quot;<br><br><em>In&nbsp; short, unlike andragogy (which basically takes the point of view of the&nbsp; adult educator), and unlike heutagogy (which focuses on self-directed&nbsp; learners), paragogy looks at the learning environment as a whole.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; Accordingly, it relates to other theories of an &quot;ecological&quot; and&nbsp; contextual nature, drawing inspiration in this regard particularly from&nbsp; Nishida&#x27;s notion of basho (&quot;shared context in motion&quot;) which helps us&nbsp; think about how a context constrains or supports different types of&nbsp; (inter-)actions, and also about how we can (re-)shape the contexts we&nbsp; find ourselves in.<br><br><em>Additional&nbsp; connections are basically in two subsections: &quot;human ecology&quot;, and&nbsp; &quot;theories of learning&quot;.&nbsp; There are significant points of overlap.</em><br><br><strong>the view from human ecology</strong><br><br>Strategic Niche Management is focuses on system change, zooming in on three levels...<br><br>This is relevant because we&#x27;re talking about a system (like P2PU.org or a given class like Collaborative Lesson Planning, etc.) and looking at how change works within that system<br><br>&#171;<em>The&nbsp; multi-level perspective argues that transitions come about through&nbsp; interactions between processes at three levels: <strong>niche</strong></em><em>-innovations (peer) build up internal momentum, through learning&nbsp; processes (meta-learning) , price&#x2F;performance&nbsp; improvements, and support from powerful&nbsp; groups; changes at the landscape level create pressure on the regime; destabilisation of the&nbsp; regime creates windows of opportunities for niche innovations.</em>&#187; (Can <em>be reinterpreted to talk about a learning context.)</em><br><br><strong><em>The&nbsp; internal processes themselves have three phases: &quot;</em>coupling of&nbsp; expectations<em>&quot;, &quot;</em>articulation&#x2F;learning<em>&quot;, and &quot;</em>network formation<em>&quot;.&nbsp; (Feed these ideas back into our best practice framework and vice versa -- sort of an independent check.)</em></strong><br><br><strong>the view from theories of learning</strong><br><br>&nbsp; Contrast with P2PU defaults (are tasks sufficiently challenging?) (incorporate us &quot;testing&quot; ourselves by writing this paper and learning about paragogy?)<br><br>My&nbsp; own current view is that learning needs (a) testing&#x2F;challenges;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; compatibility with the way the learner thinks (cf. <strong><em>The Myth of Ability</em></strong> - the real life &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; good at different things and the recent unpublished study on JUMP Math -- it would be interesting to have a dialog with him and&#x2F;or see what sorts of ideas can be re-used) -- also cite stuff by Anna De Liddo on &quot;Cohere&quot; sketching concepts, articulation here, compare the RSS feed table on metameso; and (c) real motivation,&nbsp; e.g. related to power.&nbsp; <em>And they get pissed off when they are motivated, but they&#x27;re not being satisfied!&nbsp; &quot;It&#x27;s not working the way I wanted it to, but I still learned... weird response.(very paragogical) &quot;</em><br><br><strong>Putting this all together (trim and make succinct&#x2F;concrete)</strong><br><br><em>&nbsp;We&nbsp; can cite Engestrom and Schmidt (and referenced Wenger) to drive home the&nbsp; point&nbsp; that learning is an important part of any productive process,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; it is especially key in Commons Based Peer Production (CBPP).</em><br><br><br><br>We can also look at &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot; as an example of another type of system for managing productivity.<br><br><em>&#171;Given&nbsp; that production could be carried on without any firms at&nbsp; all, why and&nbsp; under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge? Coase noted that&nbsp; there are a number of transaction costs to using&nbsp; the market; the cost&nbsp; of obtaining a good or service via the market is&nbsp; actually more than&nbsp; just the price of the good. This suggests that firms will arise when&nbsp; they can arrange to produce what they need internally and somehow avoid&nbsp; these costs.&#187;</em><br><br><strong>To sum up</strong><br><br>We&nbsp; are looking for conditions of effective learning and effective&nbsp; production, particulary how to learn produce conditions where learning is effective, but also how learning plays a role&nbsp; in any effective productive enterprise.<br><br>How do people learn how to contribute to the Free World?<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>affective filter ... about tolerance for ambiguity&#x2F;failure while learning (esp. w&#x2F;in language learning)</li></ul><br><br></body>
