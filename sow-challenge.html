<body><strong><u>What makes a good challenge?</u></strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Simple setup, complex problem:</strong> The challenge uses a simple setup that requires learners to find the solution to a complex problem.<em>For example, in the &quot;Bring it all together&quot;&nbsp; challenge learners have to create a portfolio site (simple setup) but the problem they have to solve has many layers (complex) ; they have to sketch,&nbsp; design and develop wireframes to build their portfolio site.</em><u>This is important because:</u></li><li><strong>Taking on a role:</strong> learners take on an identity or a multiple set of identities such as&nbsp; programmer, collaborator, activist, ice cream lover. <u>This is important because:</u> In so doing they become committed to the space and the community in which the&nbsp; complex learning challenge is situated.?</li><li><strong>&nbsp;Having a &quot;need to know&quot;: </strong>The challenge is meaningful for the learner audience. There is a need for them to master the skills required to complete the challenge. <em>For example there is a <strong>personal</strong></em><em> motivation for the learners, such as creating your own portfolio site, or a <strong>community</strong></em><em> related one, such as leveling up and becoming a Guru&#x2F;Mentor or winning a competition among the community, and even a <strong>fun</strong></em><em> factor such as a compelling story that draws you into having a reason to solve the challenge</em>.&nbsp; A need to know could be designed as a combination of some&#x2F;all of the above.<u>This is important because:</u> In doing so the learners find the challenge meanigful and personally fulfilling.</li><li><strong>There is a clear goal:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; the challenge&#x2F;or group of challenges has a clear overall goal, such as&nbsp;&nbsp; building a portfolio. A challenge goal can consist of smaller goals or&nbsp;&nbsp; combinations, such as building a portfolio site, winning badges,&nbsp; getting community credit etc</li><li><strong>Receiving feedback:</strong> Learners receive feedback on their actions as they progress through the challenge or a group of challenges. (this could be were badges,points, progress map, spunds(!) etc come in)? <em>For example,(from the top of my head) in the Better,Faster,Stronger&nbsp; challenge, the learner get&#x27;s feedback on the time taken for his&#x2F;her&nbsp; portfolio content to load.&nbsp;</em></li><li><strong>Leveling up:</strong> Moving through levels of the challenge unlocks powers and new levels.&nbsp;</li><li>Feedback loop is assessment redo their previous action or take a new action based on the assessment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>There is risk-taking and exploration:</strong> Learners are encouraged to take risks, explore, and try new things (trial and error). For example, in the MishMash challenge you have to?<em> create grids to lay out your work and there might be several sizes of grids that you can create, so during the process you might tinker with many grid sizes (trial), make a couple of ugly layouts(error) untill you find the one that works best. *Note:something to think about is how we create a SAFE space for trial and error to happen and even been celebrated<u>. </u></em><u>This is important because:&nbsp;</u></li><li><strong>There are many solutions to the same problem: </strong>different users can solve the same problem in different ways.?<em> </em>Being able to compare the different solutions is equally important. <u>This is important because:</u></li><li><strong>Flow:</strong> Learners feel that there is<em> flow</em> in the experience, the challenge tasks are &#8221;doable,&#8221; but increasingly challenging. ?{chart here <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;bit&#x2e;ly&#x2F;qXjL7X">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;qXjL7X</a> } Built-in scaffolding can help one overcome difficulties in a challenge that, if too difficult, could prevent them from moving forward.&nbsp; However, it&#x27;s important not to build in so much scaffolding that&nbsp; students can get through the challenge without actually&nbsp; learning anything {ref. Hussain,Taib}</li><li><strong>A sense of agency:</strong> Learners feel a real sense of agency and control over what they are learning and doing in the challenge.? For example, there could be an ability to edit some challenges and remix them or a requirement to create your own challenge after completing this first set.&nbsp;<em><u> </u></em><u>This is important because:</u></li></ul><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Peer and individual experience are blended</li><li>Replayability</li><li>Choice</li><li>Context: challenges level up and tie to an overall context; that could be called a Quest.</li></ul><br><br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Interactions</strong>:&nbsp; challenges (in games) are are all about interactions with objects,&nbsp;&nbsp; environments, and avatars. These interactions must align&nbsp; with learning&nbsp; objectives without distracting learners from the concept&nbsp; at hand.&nbsp;</li></ul><strong><u>How to design a challenge</u></strong><br><br></body>
