Proposals can use a broad range of communication formats and experiences, such as mobile and broadcast media, virtual learning environments, exhibitions, TV, radio, films, citizen science, and after-school and&#x2F;or out-of-school programs.&nbsp; Proposals that help learners identify, navigate, and integrate among multiple resources are particularly encouraged. Investigators should make a case for the innovative contributions of such deliverables. Examples include building innovative technology platforms with multiple uses, creating virtual organizations, building cross-sector partnerships, or developing connections among the wealth of existing informal science education resources in the physical and online worlds.&nbsp; Such approaches should advance the field toward a more seamless informal learning infrastructure in which participants can learn anywhere and anytime, and are deliberately supported to deepen their STEM expertise over their lifetimes.&quot;<br><br>Most promising grant categories for us:<br><br>&quot;3. Pathways projects relate to the &quot;design, develop, and test&quot; component of the DRL cycle of innovation. They include planning activities, pilot studies, and feasibility studies, or, in general, innovative work that is on a path toward a major ISE project (Research, Full-Scale Development, or Broad Implementation) but needs to address critical issues or decisions before major projects can be formulated. Pathways proposals should be more focused than general planning work normally required for submission of a major proposal, and should result in lessons learned that can inform the informal science education field as well as the project team. Not all of the Pathways projects will necessarily result in a subsequent proposal.<br><br>Pathways projects can be funded for up to $250,000 total and up to two years in duration.<br><br>4. Full-Scale Development projects relate to the &quot;implement, study efficacy, and improve&quot; component of the DRL cycle of innovation. These projects generate an innovative idea or approach to informal science education, develop and fully implement the concept, and evaluate its effectiveness. Such initiatives can be directed at improving STEM learning by the public, increasing capacity of the professional audience, contributing to the informal science education infrastructure, or embracing several of these goals. While many Full-Scale Development projects create complete STEM learning resources, programs, or experiences, they need to be guided by an explicit conceptual framework and should generate significant knowledge about impact and efficacy.<br><br>Full-Scale Development proposals typically will be funded in the $1 million to $3 million total range and may be up to five years in duration; projects requiring less than $1 million total can also be supported.&quot;<br><br><br><u>==== Wave III - NGLC ====</u><br><br><strong>Proposal Deadline&#x2F; Three possible submission dates:</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>11 Nov 2011</strong></li><li><strong>9 Feb 2012</strong></li><li><strong>8 June 2012</strong></li></ul><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;nextgenlearning&#x2e;org&#x2F;the&#x2d;grants&#x2F;wave&#x2d;iii&#x2d;challenges">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextgenlearning.org&#x2F;the-grants&#x2F;wave-iii-challenges</a><br><br>&lt;snip&gt;<br><br>Wave IIIb: Breakthrough Models for College Completion<br><br>Our priority: Innovative delivery models that generate high student<br>outcomes at affordable cost<br><br>Our vision for Wave IIIb is to spotlight innovative delivery models<br>that generate high student outcomes at an affordable cost.
