Broadly, they create opportunities for others to learn. By the way, this doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t want our technology to support the learners themselves, quite the contrary. We think that making course builders happy is the best way to make learning awesome and everybody happy.<br><br>Most members of the core P2PU community create courses (consisting of content and a group of people learning together, typically with a facilitator). That model will remain our cornerstone for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;<br><br>But there are a million other ways that people can learn with each other and we want to enable more of them. In order to do that we partner with people who want to build technology that goes way beyond the course model. We started making our core technology more modular to make it easier for these folks to expand it, and we are planning events and outreach to grow a community of technologists around P2PU.<br><br>What this means:<br><br>Homepage<br><ul class="bullet"><li>We want to more clearly communicate that learning at P2PU happens in many different ways and that there is an amazing community of course builders and innovators building this thing. In addition to featuring courses, we plan to use our home page to better promote lab projects that are ready for use. We will also showcase new ideas coming from the community, and make it easier to get involved. P2PU.org will be your entry point to a variety of learning opportunities and your pathway into the community.</li><li>Next steps:<ul class="bullet"><li>Prepare a wireframe &#x2F; proposal for feedback from the community.</li><li>If you have specific ideas for this, please share them on the list for discussion, or contact dirk@p2pu.org directly.</li></ul></li></ul><br>Core platform &amp; apps<br><ul class="bullet"><li>A set of core features &amp; services that we provide. Currently this includes: Profiles, Courses, Course list, Achievements &amp; Badges, and Schools.</li><li>Next steps:<ul class="bullet"><li>Improve and simplify the course experience (collapse courses, study groups, challenges into one model that keeps the best features and gets rid of everything else).</li><li>Modularize the underlying architecture, so that different parts speak to each other through clearly defined interfaces that can be opened up as public APIs in the future.</li></ul></li></ul><br>Lab projects<br><ul class="bullet"><li>This is our space to experiment with new tools. Some built by us. Most built by our awesome community. Things that work, will be more centrally supported and potentially rolled into the platform. The API built by Jose, Alex K&#x27;s Mentoring@P2PU and the Mechanical MOOC are first examples of great lab projects.</li><li>Next steps:<ul class="bullet"><li>Make it easier to expand the platform: roll out the API (and expand it), provide a CSS style guide that makes it easier to build lab projects with the P2PU look &amp; feel, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><br><br>Where we are at?<br><br>Where we would like to be?<br><br>How are we planning on getting there?<br><br>How can you help?<br><br><br></body>
