Based at the University of Minnesota, she focuses on the fluctuation of average temperatures, comparing historical records with contemporary weather data. Her work is deeply enmeshed with the ongoing act of measuring.&nbsp;<br><br>Tools: While much of the weather data that our researcher collects comes from third parties, she does a substantial amount of first-hand data collection. She uses highly sensitive thermometers.&nbsp; To measure more openly, she would use thermometers built with both open hardware and open software. If like many scientists she builds her instruments and creates custom software to run them, she would share the schematics and methods for the instruments, and both share and license the software so that other people could both use and build on her work.<br>Software for data processing&#x2F;analysis: using R instead of Stata. Otherwise, the software may not be available to all of her students, or collaborators at other institutions.&nbsp;<br><br>Content: The results of our researcher&#x27;s measurements are data. To measure more openly, she would share that data publicly and accessibly in open formats and with good documentation (which itself is available under an open license), and make clear that she does not claim any proprietary rights in the data, possibly through a data license (depending on her jurisdiction).<br>She publishes articles on the results of her research, and either publishes in OA journals or publishes her articles in traditional journals and deposits the final versions in her university&#x27;s institutional repository.<br><br>Processes: Processes govern both our researcher&#x27;s use of tools and the production and management of data. To measure more openly, our researcher would share, perhaps on a blog or a discipline-specific open science website, her methods for creating and using her tools, the assumptions implicit in her research, and the statistical processes she uses to analyze her data. (See how other researchers use open lab-books, and how they benefit from working &quot;in the open&quot;)<br><br>4 open practices<br><ol class="number"><li>use and build on: The researcher uses large amounts of public and government produced weather data, combines it with the data she has collected herself, and produces large comprehensive datasets of temperature data in the United States.</li><li>facilitate sharing: She shares her data publicly, in open formats, with clear documentation.&nbsp;</li><li>enable reuse and adaptation: She shares her data publicly, in open formats, with clear, openly licensed documentation.&nbsp;</li><li>support transparency: She writes about her processes publicly, and welcomes both scrutiny and contributions from her colleagues.&nbsp;</li></ol><br><br>=== Pieter ===<br><br>Teaching, writing, editing, collaborating, learning<br><br>Franzie volunteers as a tutor to students at 826 Valencia. Last week he was working with a 10th grade girl, Shashona, on a writing project. She was struggling to round out the conclusion of her short story. Franzie had an idea that Shashona should get her classmates to help her end the story. This seems like a more open way to do things that could really benefit everyone. Shashona can get helpful feedback and tips, her peers get the experience of helping with editing and the writing. How can Franzie use the School of Open to help Shashona share her work with her peers?<br><br>Using&#x2F;building on &#x2F;&#x2F;<br><ul class="indent"><li>- content: Shashona could go through the web looking for short stories and getting ideas for how to end hers; even better, she could limit her reading to only CC licensed blogs&#x2F;sites</li><li>- tools: lots of open source software tools exist for publishing writing on the web, like Wordpress, which is free and has lots of interesting&#x2F;useful plugins (and can also be built upon in the future)</li><li>- processes: Shashona might find some helpful writing&#x2F;brainstorming processes on the web</li><li><br></li></ul>Enabling use, adaptation and sharing of &#x2F;&#x2F;<br><ul class="indent"><li>- content: to encourage more adaptation of her work, Shashona can attach a CC license that enables derivatives;&nbsp;<ul class="indent"><li>Q: are there spaces where you can list CC only materials that create more exposure? link between &quot;encourage more adaption&quot; and CC</li></ul></li><li>- tools: the platform Shashona uses for publishing could also allow for multiple authors to edit the story - an etherpad, for example; she could also allow for commenting directly on her story, creating a public record of suggestions and ideas</li><li>- processes:&nbsp;</li><li><br></li></ul>Supporting transparency in &#x2F;&#x2F;<br><ul class="indent"><li>- content</li><li>- tools</li><li>- processes: Shashona could publish a description of her writing process along with the story - this might inspire comments from people about how to spark some new creative ideas to finish the story</li></ul><br>Things to think about in openness &#x2F;&#x2F;<br><ul class="indent"><li>- examples of people who do this (Cory D.)</li><li>- online communities where she can submit content for review&#x2F;help</li><li>- what are the downsides to using a CC license in this scenario?

He sells most of his work to advertising agencies. One of his specialities is the mashing-up of different images (using Photoshop). He not only uses his own photos to creates these collages, but often includes photos he finds on the web or in old magazines. He wants to know what the legal regulations are that govern the use of this content - he doesn&#x27;t want to get in trouble or have to pay royalties. He is also interested in sharing his work with more people online, to increase his audience and find more customers, but he is concerned that someone may take one of his photos and use it commercially without compensating him. He wants to better understand what tools &amp; practices otehr photographers use and how openly sharing affects his business model.&nbsp;<br><br>How can I find photos that can be re-used &#x2F; adapted?<br>- content: photo hosting sites that let you search by license<br>- tools: open source photo editing tools (although I think the reality is that most professional image editors are NOT using gimp)<br>- processes: search strategies<br><br>What are the legal regulations I have to follow? How do I attribute the authors? What if I made a mistake?<br>- content: what are the legal restrictions that apply to content I find online?&nbsp;<br>- tools<br>- processes<br><br>How can I share my work (both unique photos or mash-ups) openly with others?
