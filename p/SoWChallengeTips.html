<body><strong><u>What makes a good challenge?</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Simple setup, complex problem:</strong> The challenge uses a simple setup that requires learners to find the solution to a complex problem.<em>For&nbsp; example, in the &quot;Bring it all together&quot;&nbsp; challenge learners have to&nbsp; create a portfolio site (simple setup) but the problem they have to&nbsp; solve has many layers (complex) ; they have to sketch,&nbsp; design and&nbsp; develop wireframes to build their portfolio site.</em><u>This is important because:</u></li><li><strong>Taking on a role:</strong> learners take on an identity or a multiple set of identities such as&nbsp; programmer, collaborator, activist, ice cream lover. <u>This is important because:</u> In so doing they become committed to the space and the community in which the&nbsp; complex learning challenge is situated.?</li><li><strong>&nbsp;Having a &quot;need to know&quot;: </strong>The&nbsp; challenge is meaningful for the learner audience. There is a need for&nbsp; them to master the skills required to complete the challenge. <em>For example there is a <strong>personal</strong></em><em> motivation for the learners, such as creating your own portfolio site, or a <strong>community</strong></em><em> related one, such as leveling up and becoming a Guru&#x2F;Mentor or winning a competition among the community, and even a <strong>fun</strong></em><em> factor such as a compelling story that draws you into having a reason to solve the challenge</em>.&nbsp; A need to know could be designed as a combination of some&#x2F;all of the above.<u>This is important because:</u> In doing so the learners find the challenge meanigful and personally fulfilling.</li><li><strong>There is a clear goal:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the challenge&#x2F;or group of challenges has a clear overall goal, such&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; building a portfolio. A challenge goal can consist of smaller goals&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; combinations, such as building a portfolio site, winning badges,&nbsp;&nbsp; getting community credit etc</li><li><strong>Receiving feedback:</strong>&nbsp; Learners receive feedback on their actions as they progress through the&nbsp; challenge or a group of challenges. (this could be were badges,points,&nbsp; progress map, spunds(!) etc come in)? <em>For&nbsp; example,(from the top of my head) in the Better,Faster,Stronger&nbsp;&nbsp; challenge, the learner get&#x27;s feedback on the time taken for his&#x2F;her&nbsp;&nbsp; portfolio content to load.&nbsp;</em></li><li><strong>Leveling up:</strong> Moving through levels of the challenge unlocks powers and new levels.&nbsp;</li><li>Feedback loop is assessment redo their previous action or take a new action based on the assessment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>There is risk-taking and exploration:</strong>&nbsp; Learners are encouraged to take risks, explore, and try new things&nbsp; (trial and error). For example, in the MishMash challenge you have to?<em>&nbsp; create grids to lay out your work and there might be several sizes of&nbsp; grids that you can create, so during the process you might tinker with&nbsp; many grid sizes (trial), make a couple of ugly layouts(error) untill you&nbsp; find the one that works best. *Note:something to think about is how we create a SAFE space for trial and error to happen and even been celebrated<u>. </u></em><u>This is important because:&nbsp;</u></li><li><strong>There are many solutions to the same problem: </strong>different users can solve the same problem in different ways.?<em> </em>Being able to compare the different solutions is equally important. <u>This is important because:</u></li><li><strong>Flow:</strong> Learners feel that there is<em> flow</em> in the experience, the challenge tasks are &#8221;doable,&#8221; but increasingly challenging. ?{chart here <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;bit&#x2e;ly&#x2F;qXjL7X">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;qXjL7X</a>&nbsp; } Built-in scaffolding can help one overcome difficulties in a&nbsp; challenge that, if too difficult, could prevent them from moving&nbsp; forward.&nbsp; However, it&#x27;s important not to build in so much scaffolding&nbsp; that&nbsp; students can get through the challenge without actually&nbsp; learning&nbsp; anything {ref. Hussain,Taib}</li><li><strong>A sense of agency:</strong> Learners feel a real sense of agency and control over what they are learning and doing in the challenge.?&nbsp; For example, there could be an ability to edit some challenges and&nbsp; remix them or a requirement to create your own challenge after&nbsp; completing this first set.&nbsp;<em><u> </u></em><u>This is important because:</u></li></ul>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Peer and individual experience are blended</li><li>Replayability</li><li>Choice</li><li>Context: challenges level up and tie to an overall context; that could be called a Quest.</li></ul>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Interactions</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp; challenges (in games) are are all about interactions with objects,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; environments, and avatars. These interactions must align&nbsp; with learning&nbsp;&nbsp; objectives without distracting learners from the concept&nbsp; at hand.&nbsp;</li></ul><strong><u>How to design a challenge</u></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><br></body>
