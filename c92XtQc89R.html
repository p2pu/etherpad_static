(pl. -ries) a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something<br><br><strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br><br><br><strong>Peer-to-peer</strong> (<strong>P2P</strong>) learning has been recorded since at least the 4th century before the common era. Moving forward it has become particularly ubiquitous in the present. This is partially thanks to new computing tools that allow peers to learn harmoniously and efficiently. Paragogy is a theory of P-to-P learning. Its current iteration is independent of technology, although many of our examples will be from the modern digital age. Paragogy demands peers take learning seriously. This paper outlines paragogy&#x27;s relevance, challenge, offer and connections to other theories. Next it gives examples of paragogy implemented, then the authors implement it themselves critiquing their experience working at The Peer 2 Peer University. All theories have limitations which we attempt to see, before closing with a vision and what may lie ahead.<br><br>This paper describes a new <strong><em>theory</em></strong> of peer-to-peer learning and teaching that we call &quot;paragogy&quot;. Paragogy&#x27;s principles were developed by adapting the Knowles principles of andragogy to peer-based learning contexts. Paragogy addresses the challenge of peer-producing a useful and supportive context for self-directed learning.<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>1-sentence dictionary definition for this paper?<ul class="bullet"><li>disciplined social practice?<ul class="bullet"><li>within that when do you become an expert?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>&lt; 140 character summary of each section ... seed hashtag discussion</li><li>come up w&#x2F;definitions for the context of this paper of &quot;peer&quot; &#x2F; learning &#x2F; certain terms</li></ul><br>Agenda for Friday: plan to get things done by Sunday -&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>What do we mean by theory?

Yet your friend will be required to teach you about the locale: where to eat, what museums are worthwhile, what night spots are fun, etc.&nbsp; In this context your friend is more knowledgeable and teaches as you learn. If visit had been to your city instead, these roles would be reversed. This is a simple example of peer learning, a widespread subcategory of social learning &lt;Bandura&gt;<strong>, </strong>and perhaps as ubiquitous as communication or thought itself &lt;Jung, Chapter 1&gt;.<br><br>We use the term <em>paragogy</em> to characterize the study and practice of peer learning. The growth and evolution of opportunities for learning outside of formal institutions in recent years has made a theory of peer learning of timely importance.&nbsp; A recent article from Fast Company, an influential business magazine, illustrates the point:<em> &quot;Just as more and more employees are expected to have basic multi-media skills--the ability to blog, for example, or to shoot images or videos on their smartphones--so will they be expected to have the basic ability to share knowledge with their peers.&quot; (2011)</em><br><br>But strategies for paragogy can be found by looking back through human history. For instance, in 1645 peers came together in London to &quot;<em>refuse&nbsp; to believe things that weren&#x27;t demonstrably true.&quot;&nbsp; </em>(Shirky, 2010, p. 136)<em> </em>Initially they called themselves the Invisible College. They<em> </em>&quot;put chemistry on a sound footing in a matter of a couple of decades&quot; and &quot;established the many of the norms underpinning the scientific method&quot; (Shirky, 2010, p. 137). As time went by they&nbsp; and &quot;its&nbsp; members formed the core of the Royal Society, a much less invisible&nbsp; organization chartered in 1662 and still in operation to this day.&quot; (Shirky, 2010). Cf. <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsociety&#x2e;org&#x2F;about&#x2d;us&#x2F;history&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsociety.org&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;history&#x2F;</a><br><br>Somewhat less recently in 380 B.C.E. Socrates and Meno had a discussion about virtue, where they took turns questioning and answering one another.<br><br><strong><em>Socrates. </em></strong><em>And I, Meno, like what I am saying. Some things I have said of which I am not altogether confident. But that we shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think that we ought to enquire, than we should have been if we indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no use in seeking to know what we do not know; that is a theme upon which I am ready to fight, in word and deed, to the utmost of my power.</em><br><br><em>Meno. There again, Socrates, your words seem to me excellent.</em><br><br><strong><em>Soc. Then, as we are agreed that a man should enquire about that which he does not know, shall you and I make an effort to enquire together into the nature of virtue?</em></strong><br><br><em>SOCRATES: Then, Meno, the conclusion is that virtue comes to the virtuous by the gift of God.&nbsp; But we shall never know the certain truth until, before asking how virtue is given, we enquire into the actual nature of virtue.&nbsp; <strong>I fear that I must go away, but do you, now that you are persuaded yourself, persuade our friend Anytus.</strong></em><em>&nbsp; And do not let him be so exasperated; if you can conciliate him, you will have done good service to the Athenian people.</em><br><br>Though it was not called by the same name, the Invisible College, Socrates and Meno were implementing paragogy as they did work that would be used by humans hundreds or thousands of years later.&nbsp; Drawing inspiration from them, we offer here our paragogical principles for your examination and critique.<br><br><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong><br><br><em>&#171;Nobody needs to teach rural communities about &quot;group effort&quot; and &quot;self-help&quot;.&#187;</em><br><br>So begins A. T. Ariyaratne&#x27;s essay on Rural Self Help.&nbsp; He continues:<br><br><em>&#171;The real question, therefore, is to examine what are the constraints that exist inhibiting the expression of their group effort and self-help qualities designed to improve food and nutrition levels, clothing, shelter, health, sanitation, education and cultural life?&#187;</em><br><br>It is in a similar spirit that we look at peer learning. Everyone is capable of developing effective learning strategies and techniques, but they do this subject to certain constraints: in particular, the constraint of <em>not yet knowing</em>.&nbsp; Peer learning is different from other forms of collaboration, the proverbial &quot;barnraising&quot; for example, in which it can be assumed that the persons involved know how to build barns.<br><br>Critical questioning like Ariyaratne&#x27;s can help people practice paragogy &quot;I asked them what their biggest need was [...] I got the people to analyse their problem themselves assuring that there&nbsp; was nobody except themselves able to solve this problem.&quot;&nbsp; Much like the &quot;Socratic method&quot;, the virtues we learn are the ones we practice &lt;Benkler+Nissenbaum&gt;.&nbsp;<strong> </strong>In practical terms, the theory of paragogy aims to provide a system for quickly learning about and adapting in relation to the resource landscape.<br><br><strong>WHAT WE OFFER</strong><br><br><strong><em>Thus far we have five principles, describing &quot;candidate&quot; best practices for peer learning.</em></strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Changing context as a decentered center</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>In paragogy, we recognize that we are not merely teachers or learners, but are actually co-creating the learning context as a whole. Context is always flexible and paragogy asks learners to cultivate a &#8220;shared context in&nbsp; motion&#8221; with their peer group to best support their learning.&nbsp; It is this central role of working on the learning context that makes paragogy different from other theories of learning.</li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Meta-learning as a font of knowledge.</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Thomas Friedman suggested that<em> &quot;learning to learn&quot;</em> will be a requirement for success in our &quot;flat&quot; 21st century world. Putting this into practice requires people to work smart: &quot;&#x27;Working more hours&#x27; does not necessarily mean &#x27;producing more output&#x27;.&quot;Footnote: &lt;<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikipedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scrum&#x5f;&#x25;28development&#x25;29&#x23;Meetings">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scrum_%28development%29#Meetings</a>&gt; Scrums in Agile Software development . Figuring out what works (evaluating both process and outcomes) is a critical aspect of learning to learn.Footnote: See comments by Dr. Marjorie King in a discussion about paragogical evaluation on P2PU <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;general&#x2F;node&#x2F;15138&#x2F;forums&#x2F;25213&#x23;comment&#x2d;10331&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;general&#x2F;node&#x2F;15138&#x2F;forums&#x2F;25213#comment-10331)</a></li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Peers are equals, but different.</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Learners must not seek only confirmation of what they already know, they must confront and make sense of difference as part of the learning experience. In peer a learning context, the peers co-create the &quot;learning opportunities&quot;. They do this particularly by asking&nbsp; and answering questions, but also by suggesting readings, and generally bringing their experience to bear.<ul class="bullet"><li><em>Words under this principle don&#x27;t seem to relate to the principle itself.</em><ul class="bullet"><li>current version definitely doesn&#x27;t emphasize &quot;equal&quot; or what it means to be a peer... it does talk about learning experience, but that&#x27;s a different issue - maybe revise principle accordingly?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Learning is distributed and nonlinear.</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Learning does not go in a straight line, and paragogy stresses that individuals need to be comfortable being open to new directions while incorporating relevant knowledge, and still stay focused enough to actualize their learning goals. Involvement in shaping the learning context is one way to make the &quot;nonlinear overhead&quot; explicit, and this can ultimately support learning better than alternative models where learning is &quot;taken as given&quot;.</li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Realize the dream if you can, then wake up!</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Paragogy is the art of fulfilling motivations when this is possible, and then going on to the next thing. To use an example from literature: James O Incadenza from Infinite Jest successfully studied and then excelled in a variety of fields: &quot;<em>His record up until then indicated that he remained obsessed with something until he became successful at it, then transferred his obsession to something else. From military optics to annular optics to entrepreneurial optics to tennis-pedagogy to film.</em>&quot; (IJ p. 949)&nbsp; Chances are, unlike Incandenza, you may struggle to actualize your dream, in which case mind these words from Samuel Beckett:<em> &quot;Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.&quot; </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikiquote&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samuel&#x5f;Beckett"><em>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samuel_Beckett</em></a></li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>CONNECTIONS</strong><br><br><strong>Closely related theories</strong><br><br>The first point of connection is to andragogy, Malcom Knowles&#x27;s theory&#x2F;practice of adult education. In succinct form, Knowles&#x27;s five principles of andragogy are as follows: (1) that adult learners are&nbsp; self-directed; (2) that they bring a wealth of experience to the&nbsp; educational setting; (3) that they enter educational settings ready to learn; (4) that they are problem-centered in their learning; and (5) that they are best motivated by internal factors. &lt;Blondy&gt; points out both uses and challenges to each of Knowles principles of&nbsp; andragogy. For example, &quot;Cheren stated that while learners may express a&nbsp; desire to be self-directed in their learning, most lack the required understanding of learning necessary to be self-directed and thus need&nbsp; guidance and encouragement in the learning process.&quot;<br><br>The paragogical principles were first conceived by turning Knowles&#x27;s principles on their edge.<strong><em>&nbsp; In short, unlike andragogy (which takes the point of view of the&nbsp; adult educator), pedagogy (which studies teachers teaching learners) and unlike heutagogy (which focuses on self-directed learners), paragogy looks at the learning environment as a whole.</em></strong><em>&nbsp; </em>Accordingly, in addition to theories about learning, paragogy connects to other theories of an &quot;ecological&quot; form. In particular, we draw from Nishida&#x27;s notion of <em>basho</em> (&quot;shared context in motion&quot;), a concept that helps us look at how a context constrains or supports different types of&nbsp; (inter-)actions, and about how we can (re-)shape the contexts we find ourselves in.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We survey other related themes on ecology and learning in the subsections that follow.<br><br><strong>View from Human Ecology</strong><br><br>Bateson&#x27;s <em>Ecology of Mind</em> integrates ecology with learning, and has several parallels with paragogy.<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><em>The interaction between parts of mind is triggered by difference. </em>[Peers are equal but different]</li><li><em>Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determination. </em>[Learning is distributed and nonlinear]</li><li><em>In mental process the effects of difference are to be regarded as transforms (that is, coded versions) of the difference which preceded them. The description and classification of these&nbsp; processes of transformation discloses a hierarchy of logical types&nbsp; immanent in the phenomena. </em>[Meta-learning is a font of knowledge.]</li></ul><br>In peer learning, one of the key concerns is how peers organize together to be more efficient than independent minds acting alone.&nbsp; The impetus to produce firms and post-firm commons have been discussed by Coase and then, following on, by Benkler <strong>&lt;Coase, Benkler&gt;.&nbsp; </strong>Some of the relevant factors are discussed in the theory of Strategic Niche Management.&nbsp; &lt;Geels&gt;, &lt;Kemp&gt;.&nbsp; Three factors are said to influence niches (which could be populated by institutions, but also individual learners or informal organizations like courses or study groups):<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>(1) <em>innovations build up internal momentum</em></li><li>(2) <em>changes take place at the landscape level</em></li><li>(3) <em>destabilizations of regimes provide opportunities for niches&nbsp;</em></li></ul><br>Within niches (where, again, any group of peer learners would be an example), momentum is thought to accumulate by:&nbsp;<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>(1) <em>coupling expectations</em>: agreeing on a social contract, co-creating the syllabus</li><li>(2) <em>articulation&#x2F;learning</em>: actually do the work, develop conceptual structures that are relevant, discuss them</li><li>(3) <em>by network formation</em>: what are the (social) outcomes via network effects?</li></ul><br><strong><em>I feel like there needs to be a tie-up sentence here: explain again why this is here (should probably be made more clear above too).</em></strong><br><br><strong>View from learning theories</strong><br><br>One current relevant reference is Karpike and&nbsp; Roediger&#x27;s&nbsp; &quot;<em>The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning</em>&quot;.&nbsp; The point of this article is that repeated testing is apparently a better way to learn than just studying, or (per the follow-up paper by Karpicke and Blunt <em>&quot;Retreival Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping&quot;</em>), more effective than just sketching out concepts.<br><br>Nevertheless, it would be impossible to argue that &quot;conceptual structures&quot; are unimportant for learning. Indeed, as de Liddo et al. indicate, developing facilities that help people make their learning interactions explicit is vitally important.&nbsp; More generally, accomodating the way people think is key: here we can also look to the notion of <em>&quot;A strong affective filter (e.g. high anxiety)&quot;</em> &lt;Krashen <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;sdkrashen&#x2e;com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;eta&#x5f;paper&#x2F;index&#x2e;html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdkrashen.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;eta_paper&#x2F;index.html</a>&gt; inhibiting learning, and the willingness of some learners to take vital risks.<br><br>On that note, learners need real motivations.&nbsp; In the words of Alfie Kohn, &quot;Ask not what will motivate my students, but how they are already motivated.&quot;<br><br><strong>IMPLEMENTING</strong><br><br>To show that paragogy is neither a pure abstraction nor a trivial practice, we will explore three concrete examples of paragogy implemented.<br><br>The first example comes from the US Military&#x27;s<strong> </strong><em>After Action Review</em><strong> </strong>(AAR). The AAR is a systemized chance for everyone to review what just happened in a training exercise, to learn from it going forward.&nbsp; While one person may play the role of an evaluator in such a review (and despite the fact that solidiers are differently ranked), the review itself is still amongst peers, and critiques the operations of the unit as a whole. The four steps in an AAR are:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Review&nbsp; what was supposed to happen (training plans).</li><li>Establish what happened.</li><li>Determine what was right or wrong with what happened.</li><li>Determine how the task should be done differently the next time.</li></ul><br>Any peer group learning anything would be wise to draw on the US Army&#x27;s AAR and implement a similar formal review as part of their own learning practices.<br><br>Another example of paragogy in action came from Charles Darwin and the &quot;Gentlemen Naturalists&quot;. Later in his career Darwin stated, &quot;I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the subject of evolution, and&nbsp; never once met with any sympathetic agreement.&quot; [...] &quot;I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by Natural Selection, but signally failed.&quot; This would be similar to sending an e-mail out to mailing list on a topic you of interest. Negative feedback is better than none at all and can form part of a good long-term learning and discovery process.<br><br>Finally, one of the most successful implementations of&nbsp; paragogy in contemporary America is Alcoholics Anyonymous. A <em>peer support group</em> where peers come together to accomplish a common goal, namely to stop drinking. In the words of co-founder Bill W.<br><br><em>&quot;I think that the gentle Russian prince who so strongly advocated the idea felt that if men were granted absolute liberty, and were compelled to obey no one in person, they would voluntarily associate themselves in the common interest.&nbsp; AA is an association of the benign sort the prince envisioned.&quot;</em> Bill W. in A.A. Comes of Age (AA World Services, Inc., New York, 1957), page 224. via <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;lewrockwell&#x2e;com&#x2F;white&#x2F;white45&#x2e;html">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lewrockwell.com&#x2F;white&#x2F;white45.html</a><br><br>Within AA, peers have a common goal: learning how to be sober. Within this context, evaluation is (painfully) clear: learning was successful if the new learner stays sober, and isn&#x27;t if not.&nbsp; A couple of points from their &quot;benign anarchy&quot; model could be applied in other learning scenarios.<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>There is a clear sense that participants are part of the group, and are equal to the other people in the group.</li><li>AA doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t provide everything: this gives a clear sense of the distinction between pedagogy and paragogy.</li></ul><br>Despite being an &quot;anarchy&quot; the peer learning group succeeds by helping people to stay sober every day.<br><br><strong>KEY MESSAGE</strong><br><br><strong><em>The paragogy principles provide guidelines on best practices for building successful peer learning experiences. In this section we will bring the principles together with lessons learned from our work at P2PU. We evaluate these experiences, mainly focusing on our experiences in courses, using guidelines drawn from <u>Defining Open Source Software Project Succes</u>s and the </em>theory of<em> <u>deliberate practice</u>.&nbsp; We have selected these sources because they are directly relevant to learning in a peer context.</em></strong><br><br><strong><em>Changing Context as a decentered center ::</em> <em>Structure and semantics</em></strong><br><br>This relates to the &lt;de Liddo&gt; paper about conceptual mapping (flow charts, bubble diagrams, system design principles: maybe include an example picture here): the idea here is to map out a peer learning system and to say how it works.

Yet, we, the organizers, have learned lessons about what does or does not make groups work. Do like an AAR of 1 course? Intersplice comments form other courses? ...

An eminently practical rephrasing&nbsp; of the question is: &quot;What do we need to know, and what do we need to be able to do, to work effectively and to lead full, happy lives?&quot;&nbsp; Our vision, then, is of increasing knowledge about learning as it connects with productivity.&nbsp; We hope that paragogy can form part of a critical approach, part of a benevolent and widely distributed &quot;pyriamid scheme&quot; for peer producing better support for learning (similar to Linux or Wikipedia).&nbsp;<strong> <em>We are happy whenever bug reports for learning are being submitted and addressed.</em></strong><br><br><strong>SYNTHESIS (TBA)</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>the changes in technology provide an opportunity at the niche level of&nbsp; learning science to develop an expanded microgenetic analysis of learning</strong></li><li><strong>Ranciere (sp) provides one example of relevant critical thinking relative to socrates</strong><ul class="bullet"><li><em>The&nbsp; name &quot;paragogy&quot; is a (bilingual) pun on the notion of production.&nbsp;</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Transversality: how much do different levels talk? &lt;Guattari&gt;</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>Example to follow: RMS responding to individual e-mails?</li></ul></li></ul><br>We recognize that the answers will be heterogeneous.&nbsp; But there will be&nbsp; some common trends as well, which we have discussed at a high level in&nbsp; this paper. The idea of a &quot;Microgenetic analysis of learning&quot; that is&nbsp; able&nbsp; to &quot;measure change as it occurs&quot; is quite compatible with our&nbsp; vision, and compatible with the idea of &quot;learning analytics&quot;.&nbsp; But we&nbsp; feel that the understanding of all different types of learning at all&nbsp; levels needs to be understood better, and that&#x27;s where we hope to take&nbsp; paragogy as time goes.&nbsp; <em>(E.g. very specific examples in action maybe adding empirical examples [mathemeatics&#x2F;language schools founded on paragogy].)</em><br><br></body>
