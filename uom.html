<body>University of Maryland &#x2F; Human Computer Interaction Lab &amp; P2PU Research Study&#x2F;Partnership<br><br>Team:<br>&nbsp; * June Ahn JA (online learning, iSchool and education school)<br>&nbsp; * Brian Butler BB (online communities &#x2F; business school and iSchool)<br>&nbsp; * Cindy Weng CW (Research assistant)<br>&nbsp; * Philipp Schmidt PS<br>&nbsp; * P2PU Learning Lead TBD<br><br>Background<br>&nbsp; * We know June from writing an NSF proposal together &#x2F; does very interesting work that connects to many aspects of P2PU<br>&nbsp; * Shared example data from the course dashboard with him<br>&nbsp; * June did a review of P2PU data and thinks there are interesting questions that we could try to answer.<br><br>Potential Research Questions to Explore<br>&nbsp; * What factors motivate learners&#x27; participation&#x2F;contribution to P2PU courses? (characteristics of the course design? other group contributions? individual history or characteristics?)<br>&nbsp; * How do participation patterns (e.g. members taking more than one course) relate to future participation&#x2F;contribution?<br>&nbsp; * From Philipp&#x2F;P2PU - we have anecdotal evidence that participation in courses drops off after 2-3 weeks, is this the case, and why?&nbsp; What could we understand about this phenomena?<br>&nbsp; * Can we link members&#x27; participation in P2PU with measures of 21st Century Literacy Skills?&nbsp; e.g. Does participating in a peer to peer learning environment foster new literacy skills? (Learning analytics matched to 21st century literacy skills, need to develop a survey instrument and run periodically and track development over time)<br>&nbsp; * Are they interested in researching the badges component? Assessment approaches? (Dirk)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Not specifically at the moment - but could tie into 21st century skills yep, cool!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Yes, we would be interested in data about challenges and badges!&nbsp; They may be important factors in explaining participation (June)<br><br>Data Needed:<br>&nbsp; * Log data that goes beyond the learning dashboard<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Please be more specific (PS)<br><ul class="bullet"><li>a paper we read in the researcher&#x27;s homestead last week mentioned CANS: Context-aware Activity Notification System<ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;cansaware&#x2e;com&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cansaware.com&#x2F;</a></li><li>not obvious how easy it would be to use it with p2pu</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br><u>Data sharing &#x2F; Anonymization</u><br><br>&nbsp; * What&#x27;s the most efficient process for working together on getting data out of the system?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Manual data extraction not really an option<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Could be an automated weekly dump that UoM can download<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Or we expand the course dashboard to include missing variables<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Would require us to give &quot;admin&quot; rights to UoM researcher or design a batch process that auto-generates dashboard export files for a set of courses<br>&nbsp; * What&#x27;s the process of anonymizing the data?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * CW could help with anonymizing data &#x2F; data dumps<br><br><br><u>Privacy</u><br><br>&nbsp; * If UoM handles data it will need to follow UoM IRB standards (which should take care of the privacy concerns)<br>&nbsp; * Only if P2PU does all of the data work then UoM is exempt from IRB requirements<br><br><br><u>Open sharing of our research findings</u><br><br>Options:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; * Open Access Journals<br>&nbsp; * HCI group at UoM self-publishes all research before submitting to journals &#x2F; conferences on our HCIL website<br>&nbsp; * June self-archives all of his publications<br><br><br><u>Next steps:</u><br><br>&nbsp; * June to draft an IRB application and MoU and send IRB guidelines<br>&nbsp; * Philipp to speak to Delia about a MoU<br>&nbsp; * Philipp to talk to Dirk&#x2F; Zuzel about (1) sharing a DB Dump so UoM can analyze DB structure &#x2F; write an anonymization script<br>&nbsp; * PS and JA to investigate expanding the dashboard as an alternative solution<br>&nbsp; * P2PU has a community call on Thursdays 11 EST.&nbsp; Philipp might coordinate our team joining the call to discuss with P2PU folks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Tentative date -&gt; May 10th<br><br><br></body>
