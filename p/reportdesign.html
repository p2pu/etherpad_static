<body><strong>Us:</strong> A totally digital nonprofit, with staff all over the world, changing the way people learn together online. (www.p2pu.org)<br><strong>You:</strong> A smart, talented designer, with a passion for taking ideas and working them into something beautiful, informative and useful. In HTML5.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Cute Meetup: </strong>We are writing some reports about how we&#x27;re changing the way people learn together online. They&#x27;re interesting and important. But right now, they&#x27;re also ugly and wordy. We&#x27;re sad. One day, sitting in a coffee shop, you see our ugly word reports. Before you pluck up the courage to say hi, we leave, and pick up your umbrella by mistake. You run after us (in the rain) see our ugly, wordy reports and say &quot;Hey, I could really help you out with that.&quot; It&#x27;s like at first sight, quickly turning to love when you realise we pay invoices on time.&nbsp;<br><br>Can you help us to live happily ever after? If so, drop bekka [at] p2pu [dot] org a line....<br><br><br><br></body>
