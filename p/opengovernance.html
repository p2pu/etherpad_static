Some people talk about open source projects, also interested in how the Internet can transform democracy.<ul class="bullet"><li>Project links from Ireland? ....&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Day job: copyright specialist and the &quot;open&quot; guy (open ed&#x2F; open src&#x2F; open access), lots of open src community work - ubuntu, etc. - so know a little bit about community management, but interested to see how digital community can translate into open governance. is transparency (transcript of meeting are available) enough ... what is needed for true open governance?</li><li>Interested in ideas around family and society, privacy influence on society, mostly interested in transparency - which story? Baboon story (radiolab)</li><li>Difference in perception of value of joining communities in different countries, currently trying to build larger international communities (NAmer, SAmer, etc.). How do you build and govern and create cross-cultural communities that are inclusive?</li><li>Gender&#x2F;geographic location (West vs. rest of world) breakdown in online collaborative communities? (this course as an example) Stian: Yes, but we do have an impressive amount of women involved in other courses, running courses, and in governance compared to most other open courses. Definitively something to keep in mind though.</li><li>Chris: I&#x27;m interested in how &#x27;open&#x27; communiities move away form the self-censored approach to governance that tends to characterise online email discussion lists -&nbsp; and even social networking toos such as twitter, facebook. linkedIn, where you as the user (or list manager) sets the norms.</li><li>*tools</li><li>Maybe it&#x27;s the trainer&nbsp; in me, but explicitly stating&#x2F;setting the norms&#x2F;expectations are vital IMHO.</li><li>Jason: I&#x27;d like to explore ways that successful open communities attract interest and input from members&#x2F;volunteers, ultimately to grow interest and spread the workload. What governance models work or not?</li><li>Agre</li><li>Stian: What are the grooming processes that can help new members into the community?</li><li>Greg: If you shoot the alpha male a lot of problems go away. (Hire Sarah Palin)</li><li>Scott: Forking as the anti alpha male measure?</li></ul>Ms Palin&#x27;s selection criteria may not be terribly open and transparent - perhaps the gun should be in someonelese&#x27;s hands. The Dalai Lama?<br>Comment: I like using this area to type thoughts related to the discussion. During the call, I felt like the chat area was mostly used for discussing technical&#x2F;communication issues, and this area was for notes. At the very end, this area seemed to evolve into a place for people to type their short comments, and I think that worked well.<br><br></body>
