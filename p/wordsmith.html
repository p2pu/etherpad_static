<body><strong>School of Webcraft Charter</strong><br><br>The School of Webcraft is a joint venture between Mozilla and Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) to create a grassroots learning community <u>for web development based on open standards. </u><s>focused on <u>open</u></s><s> standards-based web development.&nbsp;</s><br><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br><br>The problem: Web developer training is expensive, out of reach, and out of touch with how the internet is evolving, especially for open web skills.<br><br>The solution: Peer learning powered by mentors and learners like you; self-organized study groups <u>which leverage</u> existing open learning materials.<br><br>The goal: Make web developer training free<u> &amp; </u>open, and globally accessible; offer skills and certification that build careers around the open web.<br><br><strong>Scope</strong><br><br>Learning opportunities and certification offered by the School of Webcraft focus exclusively on <u>open</u> standards-based web development. As an example: courses on HTML5 are in scope, courses on Flash are not. This focus is defined on an ongoing basis by the Webcraft community.&nbsp;<br><br>Courses must be built around tools that accessible to any learner free of cost and that allow participants to openly share their work. Participants in School of Webcraft courses will be required to openly license their code.<br><br><strong>Structure</strong><br><br>School of Webcraft is operated by Mozilla and P2PU in a spirit of goodwill and partnership, and eschews unnecessary bureaucracy. Decisions will be made in an open and transparent manner.&nbsp;<br><br>Mozilla <u>commits to taking leadership</u> on course and badge content, and final decisions in this area are being made according to the Mozilla Module governance structure (module still to be established.)<br><br>P2PU <u>commits to taking leadership</u> on the learning platform and assessment, and final decisions in this area are being made <u>based on P2PU values</u> and using P2PU governance structures<s> for P2PU schools</s>.&nbsp;<br><br>P2PU and Mozilla jointly control the rights to SoW names and logos.
