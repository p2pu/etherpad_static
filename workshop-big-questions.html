The city is experiencing an economic downturn, and as a consequence of that Naria looses her job. She is really struggling to work and ends up taking a part time job at a Diner simply to make ends meet. She continues to try to find better fulltime work but is unable to - even the local job center cant help her because she doesn&#x27;t have the right skills.&nbsp; Naria cant afford to pay for a university Course and doesnt have the time to go back to school fulltime.&nbsp; The advisor at the job center&nbsp; suggests that Naria might want to try P2PU, it a global community that helps people learn new things in peer groups. Naria visits the P2PU site and is amazed by this diverse, vibrant, global community. She explores many of the courses and even participates on a few before discovering she has a real passion for writing. She enrols on the Creative non -fiction writing course and after being inspired takes another course on Journalism. As part of the course she and her peers have to write blog posts reporting on news form their local communities. Naria writes a number of articles as the course progresses. One day she is contacted by a local newspaper that has come across her work. The editor is very impressed with her writing and offers Naria a job writing for the newspaper.&nbsp; Six months later Naria is browsing the P2PU site when she receives a request in her inbox from a new P2PU community member called Alice. Alice is looking for a mentor to help her get started with here Creative Non-Fiction assignment ...&nbsp;</em><br><br><br><strong>A FEW MORE THINGS MENTIONED IN THE CLOSING WORKSHOP</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>The vision of the future is that P2PU is a place to learn about anything they want</li><li>P2PU is in the world - there is no reason why someone can&#x27;t be who they want to be</li><li>People identify with P2PU</li></ul><br><br></body>
