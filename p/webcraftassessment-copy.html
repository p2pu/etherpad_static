These three reflect important skills and include a basic level&nbsp; badge, and two expert badges to cover a range of skill level. Also, the&nbsp; JS badges are hard skills, whereas the Accessibility badge is considered&nbsp; a &quot;softer&quot; skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>1)&nbsp; Javascript Expert badge</strong><br><br><em>Description:</em><br>The Javascript Expert badge recognizes high-quality, advanced Javascript knowledge and skills.<br><br><em>Justification:&nbsp;</em><br>Javascript&nbsp; is an essential language for web developers, with applicability across&nbsp; many courses. We also want to encourage people to learn advanced skills&nbsp; and aim for the expert level.<br><br><em>An Expert Javascript programmer is someone who:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>can intelligently decide between JavaScript frameworks and justify their decision.</li><li>consistently&nbsp; develops JavaScript to Douglas Crockford&#x27;s recommended style guide OR&nbsp; an alternative one that provides solid justification for its principles.</li><li>regularly reviews their code quality using JSLint, FireBug or similar tool.</li><li>implements JavaScript in conjunction with other technologies.</li><li>recognises the benefits and limitations of JavaScript and can clearly explain this to clients and peers.</li><li>understands how JavaScript is interpreted by the browser.</li><li>is aware of vulnerabilities within JavaScript and develops secure code.</li><li>can clearly describe the DOM event flow</li><li>intelligently optimises code for efficiency and speed.</li><li>implements graceful degradation as a default and understands the range of browsers and devices that will implement their code.</li><li>is aware of the historical and technology context.</li><li>can&nbsp; read and interpret relevant technology standards and are aware of how&nbsp; they can contribute and provide feedback to these standards.</li><li>shares&nbsp; their knowledge with other developers and release their code for the&nbsp; scrutiny of others (contributes to the js community).</li><li>practices regular code reviews with colleagues and peers.</li><li>clearly documents how their technical solution will respond to client requirements.</li><li>recognises the range of users accessing sites with their code and understands their varying needs.</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Details:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Learners will seek out the badge and submit work for assessment.</li><li>The&nbsp; artifact for assessment is a functioning website or js code for some&nbsp; purpose.&nbsp; We expect that many will have existing work to submit, but we&nbsp; may need to offer a couple challenge ideas for people to use to build&nbsp; something new.</li><li>With&nbsp; the submitted work&#x2F;artifact, the learner must submit a paragraph+&nbsp; describing their work and why they should get the JS Expert badge</li><li>The&nbsp; badge will be aligned with several courses (TBD in early Jan) and&nbsp; courses members can submit to the course community for guru assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those seeking the badge outside of the specific courses, we are&nbsp; considering asking several webcraft community gurus to do the&nbsp; assessments.&nbsp;</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Challenges&#x2F;Submission options:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Challenge:&nbsp; Submit a link to original code (authored and submitted by you) that&nbsp; demonstrates expert Javascript, as well as a write-up explaining the&nbsp; code and why you consider yourself a JS Expert.&nbsp;</li><li>Challenge:&nbsp; Create a wrapper that does not exist&#x2F;someone has not produced before and explain your steps and final outcome.</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Type:</em> GURU (aka, HAS THE BADGE)<br><br><em>Assessment Rubric:</em><br>Submitted code...<br><ul class="bullet"><li>is at expected expert level, exhibiting advanced js techniques and considerations</li><li>is bug free (runs in the browser without errors)</li><li>fits&nbsp; within Douglas Crockford&#x27;s recommended style guide OR an alternative&nbsp; one that provides solid justification for its principles</li><li>is secure, avoids vulnerabilities</li><li>exhibits graceful degradation</li><li>is optimized for efficiency and speed</li><li>is clearly documented, instructive of approach and choices</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Process</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Learner submits work and paragraph(s) through the dedicated OSQA environment</li><li>Peers who have already earned the badge (aka &#x27;gurus&#x27;) will assess the submission, vote Yes or No and leave comments for feedback</li><li>If Yes, the badge will be issued.&nbsp;</li><li>If No, the submitter will receive the feedback and can revise work and resubmit</li><li>Once badge is issued, it is linked back to the work&#x2F;endorsements</li></ul><br><em>Notes:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>For&nbsp; those JS Experts not in a related course, they can submit through the&nbsp; Badge page and we will have some JS community gurus who will review and&nbsp; assess.&nbsp; In this case, one Yes is sufficient to award the badge.&nbsp;</li></ul><br><strong>2) Javascript Basic badge</strong><br><em>Description:</em><br>The Javascript Basic badge recognizes mastery of initial Javascript skills.&nbsp; Aligned with Intro to Javascript course(s).<br><br><em>Justification:</em><br>Basic&nbsp; skills are a critical foundation for Javascript mastery and competency.&nbsp; This badge is an entry level badge that can be a stepping stone to the&nbsp; JS Expert badge, or could help intermediates or experts revisit and&nbsp; refresh their core skills**.<br><br><em>Assessment Details:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Learners will seek out the badge and submit work for assessment.</li><li>The artifact for assessment is the code and documentation for the following (or similar) challenges: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikiversity&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Web&#x5f;Design&#x2F;JavaScript&#x5f;Challenges">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiversity.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Web_Design&#x2F;JavaScript_Challenges</a></li></ul><br><em>Assessment Type</em>: PEER<br><br><em>Assessment Rubric</em>:<br>Submitted code...<br><ul class="bullet"><li>meets the requirements of the challenges</li><li>provides the expected behaviors or output</li><li>is bug free (runs in the browser without errors)</li><li>is clearly documented</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Process:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Learner submits code for the challenges to the course peer group</li><li>Peers review the submission against the rubric</li><li>Peers vote Yes or No and provide an endorsement&#x2F;feedback (140 characters?)</li><li>Once gets 3 Yes votes, badge is issued, along with the feedback to the learner*</li><li>If 3 Yes votes are not achieved, learner can use the feedback to revise work and resubmit for peer group to review</li><li>Once badge is issued, it is linked back to the work&#x2F;endorsements</li></ul><br><em>Requirements:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Mechanism for submitting code for assessment (wiki page?)</li><li>Mechanism for peer review (recognition that there is something to review, voting capability, commenting&#x2F;feedback)</li><li>Mechanism for learner to receive the peer review feedback (private? public?)</li><li>Mechanism for issuing badge</li><li>Badge infrastructure, where badge can be stored and linked back to the work</li></ul><br><em>Notes:</em><br><br><strong>3) Accessibility Expert badge</strong><br><em>Description:</em><br>The&nbsp; Accessibility Expert badge recognizes attitudes, perspectives, values&nbsp; and practice oriented around the importance of accessibility and&nbsp; universal design.<br><br><em>Justification:</em><br>Accessibility&nbsp; is an important set of considerations for any developer or designer and&nbsp; being aware of users&#x27; needs is an important part of creating useful and&nbsp; valuable products.&nbsp; There is no exact equation for accessibility,&nbsp; instead it requires awareness and attitudes around acceptance and&nbsp; inclusion.&nbsp;<br><br><em>An Accessibility Expert is someone who:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>is aware of the physical, technology and social challenges which can affect a website&#x27;s accessibility.</li><li>demonstrates awareness of the design and development responses and approaches which make web content more accessible.</li><li>develops accessible websites as a default.</li><li>can communicate the legal, financial and humanitarian benefits&nbsp; and responsibilities of accessible web sites to clients.</li><li>develops meaningful accessibility tests for their designs.</li><li>cooperates with end-users of different backgrounds to get feedback on their sites.</li><li>can&nbsp; read and understand W3C and relevant local standards regarding web site&nbsp; accessibility and are aware of how they can contribute and provide&nbsp; feedback to these standards.</li><li>works with design personas that reflect a range of ability and access situations.</li><li>continuously updates their skills and knowledge.&nbsp;</li><li>contributes to the development community and seeks feedback.</li><li>can evaluate websites and content for accessibility, recognize and propose solutions for issues.</li><li>develops&nbsp; an understanding of alternate user perspectives by experiencing their&nbsp; own web sites on mobile devices, via screen-readers, with slow download&nbsp; speeds.</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Details:</em><br>Learners will seek out the assessment and point people to blog or artifact demonstrating their attitudes and experiences.<br>While this badge will be aligned with&#x2F;promoted within a specific course, anyone can submit.<br><br><em>Assessment Challenge&#x2F;Submission:</em><br>Write a reflective essay in a blog post or some other shareable form on the Web about the following:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Why accessibility is important</li><li>What types of people should we be designing for</li><li>Experiences with challenged users and&#x2F;or accessibility technologies</li><li>How you build accessibility into the work you do (with examples)</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Type</em>: GURU<br>Accessibility&nbsp; evangelists in the community will be issued the badge to seed the&nbsp; community, then they will review submissions and determine who has&nbsp; earned the badge. Once someone earns the Accessibility Expert badge,&nbsp; they then become one of the assessors, creating an expanding set of&nbsp; evangelists for accessibility.<br><br><em>Assessment Rubric</em>:<br>Submission...<br><ul class="bullet"><li>demonstrates&nbsp; comprehensive awareness of the physical, technology and social&nbsp; challenges which can affect a website&#x27;s accessibility.</li><li>demonstrates awareness of the design and development responses and approaches which make web content more accessible.</li><li>communicates the legal, financial and humanitarian benefits and responsibilities of accessibility</li><li>demonstrates awareness of multiple perspectives</li><li>exhibits accessibility-oriented attitudes</li><li>provides examples of work than demonstrates accessibility orientation</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Process:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Learner submits post &#x2F; reflection</li><li>Guru reviews it against the rubric</li><li>Guru decides if badge should be issued:<ul class="bullet"><li>If Yes, Guru provides endorsement and badge is issued</li><li>If No, Guru provides feedback to learner</li></ul></li><li>Once badge is issued, it is linked back to the reflection&#x2F;endorsements</li><li>Once badge is issued, the learner can now assess&#x2F;issue this badge</li></ul><br><strong>(4) Accessibility Foundations badge</strong><br><em>Description:</em><br>The Accessibility Foundations badge recognizes general awareness and understanding of accessibility and universal design.<br><br><em>Justification:</em><br>Accessibility&nbsp; is an important set of considerations for any developer or designer and&nbsp; being aware of users&#x27; needs is an important part of creating useful and&nbsp; valuable products.&nbsp; There is no exact equation for accessibility,&nbsp; instead it requires awareness and attitudes around acceptance and&nbsp; inclusion.&nbsp;<br><br><em>An Accessibility Foundations is someone who:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>is aware of the basic physical, technology and social challenges which can affect a website&#x27;s accessibility.</li><li>communicates the importance of accessibility and universal design</li><li>understands&nbsp; a number of strategies that they can use in their own code and work to&nbsp; improve the accessibility of websites and products</li></ul><br><em>Assessment Details:</em><br>Learners&nbsp; will seek out the assessment and answer questions in a narrative either&nbsp; on their own blogs or within the assessment&#x2F;badge environment<br>This badge will be aligned with&#x2F;promoted within specific courses<br><br><em>Assessment Challenge&#x2F;Submission:</em><br>Option 1:&nbsp; Write a reflective essay in a blog post or some other shareable form on the Web to answer the following:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>In your own words, define the following: universal design, usability, accessibility?</li><li>What are 3 strategies you can take to improve the accessibility of a website?</li><li>Write&nbsp; a paragraph to a potential client about why he should budget for&nbsp; accessibility and universal design aspects of the project.</li></ul>Option&nbsp; 2: Pick a website (that no one else before you has chosen) and assess&nbsp; it for accessibility.

We are hoping to get at&nbsp; least 3-4 more skill oriented badges&#x2F;assessments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Suggestions so far:<br>PHP Basic (modeled after the Javascript Basic)<br>PHP Expert (modeled after the Javascript Expert)<br>CSS Basic (modeled after the Javascript Basic)<br>More suggestions?&nbsp; Please send them our way: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;viewform&#x3f;hl&#x3d;en&amp;formkey&#x3d;dHZPOXVNLVV1azN3OFk5MW83UEktdEE6MQ&#x23;gid&#x3d;0">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spreadsheets.google.com&#x2F;viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dHZPOXVNLVV1azN3OFk5MW83UEktdEE6MQ#gid=0</a><br><br>Update:&nbsp; based on the interest through the mailing list, looks like HTML5 and&nbsp; CSS3 are hot skills that we might consider working with relevant course&nbsp; organizers to add into the pilot.<br><br><strong><u>SOW-DEFINED COMMUNITY BADGES</u></strong><br>These&nbsp; badges are meant to help build community and recognize &#x27;softer&#x27;&nbsp; skills.&nbsp; We have defined 5 initial badges based on work with LinkedIn&nbsp; recommendations, as well as discussions with the Webcraft community.&nbsp; These badges will be available for peers to issue to other peers, along&nbsp; with an endorsement.<br><br>For all of the following badges:<br><br><em>Assessment Details</em>:<br>Badges are awarded by peers and not sought out explicitly by learners.<br><br><em>Assessment Type</em>: PEER<br><br><em>Assessment Process</em>:<br>After experience with the learner, peers can decide to award the badge based on the rubric.<br>Peer(s) issues the badge with an endorsement justifying the badge<br><br><em>Requirements</em>:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Mechanism for issuing badge and providing endorsement (accessible to all SoW participants)</li><li>Badge infrstructure</li></ul><br><em>Notes</em>:<br>If&nbsp; multiple give me the same badge, should it accumulate (so my Team&nbsp; Player badge may have a score or indication that I received it 3x).<br><br><strong><em>Badge Idea</em>s </strong><em>(note: these are not necessarily the badge names; also open to other suggestions or ideas):</em><br><br><strong>1) Team Player &#x2F; Good Teammate</strong><br><br><em>Rubric</em><strong>:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Collaborates well</li><li>Helps push work forward within the team, willing to do work for the shared goal</li><li>Exhibits sense of team spirit and shared purpose</li><li>Motivates other team members</li></ul><br><strong>2) Communicator</strong><br><br><em>Rubric</em><strong>:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Writes clearly and concisely</li><li>Accurately communicates concepts</li><li>Can explain concepts to various audiences, including nontechnical people</li><li>Maintains tone of helpfulness and respect</li></ul><br><strong>3) Problem Solver &#x2F; Innovator</strong><br><br><em>Rubric:</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Thinks critically, weighs options</li><li>Solution-oriented</li><li>Has solved problem or challenge to push work forward</li></ul><br><strong>4) Community Builder</strong><br><br><em>Rubric</em><strong>:</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Actively participates in the (course) community</li><li>Participates through social tools</li><li>Provides helpful and interested comments to others posts</li></ul><br><strong>5) Peer Mentor</strong><br><br><em>Rubric</em>:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Helps explain concepts or approaches</li><li>Volunteers extra time to help others understand topics</li><li>Answers questions and provides feedback on others work</li></ul><br><strong><u>OSQA BADGES</u></strong><br>These&nbsp; badges would be awarded automatically based on behavior within the SoW&nbsp; OSQA forums, capitalizing on stealth assessment, as well as promoting&nbsp; behaviors that are beneficial for the community.<br><br><em>Badge ideas</em> (still in progress):<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Commentator: Left 10 comments</li><li>Enthusiast: Visited the site each day for 30 consecutive days</li><li>Community Guru:&nbsp; Answered x questions with x votes up</li></ul><br><em>Notes</em>:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Erin going through the existing StackOverflow badges to see what types of behaviors we might want to start with</li><li>This is tentative based on if we can get the technology up and running in time to build in some badges</li><li>Need to see how to make these badges work with the others (is OSQA another issuer into the Hub&#x2F;Backpack?)</li></ul><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><u>OTHER BADGES</u></strong><br>These are some other ideas of badges that have come up in various conversations or calls.<br><br><strong>1) Course Organizer Badge</strong><br>This&nbsp; badge would be awarded to anyone who organizes a course (and has&nbsp; organized a course in the past, if still involved).&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be a way&nbsp; to encourage more people to organize courses. We would issue this badge&nbsp; to current course organizers, and previous ones can submit to get the&nbsp; badge and we can verify and issue.<br><br><strong>2) P2PU Veteran</strong><br>For&nbsp; those people who have taken P2PU courses before, and are back for more,&nbsp; they could get the P2PU Veteran badge (involved in 2+ courses). Someone&nbsp; could submit for the badge and list the courses they have taken and we&nbsp; could issue the badge accordingly.<br><br><strong>3) Peer-to-Organizer Badge</strong><br>For&nbsp; someone who has taken a course and then organized &#x2F; facilitated a&nbsp; course.&nbsp; We would adverstise this badge this session and hopefully&nbsp; encourage people to think about organizing&nbsp; a course that they are&nbsp; currently taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><em>Benefits</em>:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Facilitating the course is an excellent form of assessment - put your knowledge to test</li><li>Could encourage lots of people to organize a course, have multiple &#x27;sections&#x27; for popular topics</li><li>Could&nbsp; encourage higher quality courses as people reflect on what worked or&nbsp; didn&#x27;t work in their experience taking the course, while they are&nbsp; planning for their own facilitation</li></ul><br><em>Limitations</em>:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Could have overwhelming course creations (although this would be a good problem to have)</li><li>Could&nbsp; actually encourage lower quality courses if people really aren&#x27;t ready&nbsp; to facilitate (more pressure on us to have a stellar orientation)</li><li>May push out core facilitators</li></ul><br><em>Note</em>:<br>Philipp&nbsp; had an idea of potentially having a 201 course in April or later&nbsp; session taught by a community guru, where the only way to get into the&nbsp; course would be to teach a 101 course on the same topic in the previous&nbsp; section(s).&nbsp; Could do something like this to determine the group to help&nbsp; us build asynchronous courses that can be repurposed.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>:::::EVALUATION:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</strong><br>A&nbsp; critical piece of the pilot is the evaluation of the badges and&nbsp; assessments.&nbsp; We will define a more in-depth plan for the evaluation but&nbsp; some key metrics will be:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>How many times the assessment was sought out (if applicable)<ul class="bullet"><li>Within a course</li><li>Outside of a course</li></ul></li><li>How many times the badge was issued</li><li>What is the reaction from the community - are they satisfied with the badge&#x2F;assessment?</li><li>Was the badge&#x2F;assessment gamed in any way.&nbsp; If so, how?</li><li>How valuable is the work &#x27;behind&#x27; the badge (end of session evaluation by Mozilla?)</li></ul><br><strong>:::::TECHNOLOGY:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</strong><br>Many&nbsp; of the ideas and decisions around which badges&#x2F;assessments to include&nbsp; may be driven by the technology solution that we have in place for the&nbsp; January sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Currently, we are considering two parallel processes to manage the assessments and issue badges<br><br>NOTE: we plan to have more finalization around these over the next couple weeks<br><br><strong>1) OSQA ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>We are utilizing the OSQA environment to manage the badges and assessments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>for a more detailed description of the OSQA requirements and open questions, see:&nbsp;<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;etherpad&#x2e;mozilla&#x2e;org&#x3a;9000&#x2F;osqabadges">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;etherpad.mozilla.org:9000&#x2F;osqabadges</a><br><br><em>Details</em>:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Badges&#x2F;challenges for badges will be questions within the course (tag) section of OSQA or in the wider community</li><li>Users will submit their work&#x2F;artifacts&#x2F;reflections as a reply to the question</li><li>Peers or gurus will assess and vote up or down replies (essentially saying yes this meets the rubric, or no it doesn&#x27;t)</li><li>At some threshold, the badge would be awarded</li><li>Badges will be ported from the OSQA environment to the P2PU profile at the end of the session</li></ul><br><strong>2) P2PU Environment (Manual)</strong><br>The&nbsp; community oriented badges may be more manual within the P2PU&nbsp; environment.&nbsp; Still under development - trying to see if we can use OSQA&nbsp; for this...<br><br><em>Details</em><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Peer has a positive experience with another learner</li><li>Peer posts recommendation within the P2PU profile</li><li>We manually issue badges at the end of the session based on the recommendations</li></ul><br><br><strong>:::::OUTREACH:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Identify which courses that we know want to include our predefined badges in (after Jan 12)</li><li>Reach out to the course organizers that we want to use our badges within</li><li>Dedicated orientation session for course organizers</li><li>Reach out to all course organizers to see if they have ideas for badges (across orientation and first two weeks of courses)</li></ul><br><strong>:::::FEEDBACK:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</strong><br>Please feel free to add your feedback inline, or use the space below.&nbsp;
