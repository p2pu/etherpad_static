<body><strong><u>Opportunity</u></strong><br>P2PU and UCI work together to provide meaningful pathways to professional development and continuing education units for educators.&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>7 Courses developed by P2PU as part of the PD for Teachers project<ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp - I only count 5 named courses. What are the other two?<ul class="bullet"><li>Differentiating Instruction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Student Engagement and Checking for Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>OER in the K-12 Classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Using Web 2.0 and Social Media to Encourage Deeper Learning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Teaching in Blended and Online Classrooms&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>UCI CSET courses<ul class="bullet"><li>Mathematics<ul class="bullet"><li>Subtest I: Algebra and Number Theory</li><li>Subtest II: Geometry</li><li>Subtest III: Trigonometry and Calculus</li></ul></li><li>Science<ul class="bullet"><li>Subtest I: Astronomy, Earth Sciences, Waves, Forces of Motion</li><li>Subtest II: Ecology, Biology, Physical Sciences</li><li>Subtest III: Physics - June 30, 2012</li><li>Subtest III: Biology - June 30, 2012</li><li>Subtest III: Earth Sciences - N&#x2F;A</li><li>Subtest III: Chemistry - N&#x2F;A</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><strong><u>Benefits to UCI</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Scaling up certification offerings for professional development</li><li>Awareness and recognition of UCI excellence in teacher education</li><li>Deeper learning in CSET courses</li></ul><br><strong><u>Benefits to P2PU</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>High quality students and content</li><li>Valuable credentials tied to social learning experience</li><li>Connection with formal institution</li></ul><br><strong><u>How it could work</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>UCI ensures quality of course content<ul class="bullet"><li>CSET course content is exported to HTML and recreated in the P2PU environment</li><li>UCI reviews 7 PD for Teachers courses</li></ul></li><li>Cross promotion to find customers.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>P2PU course contains a link to UCI (&quot;Register with UCI if you are a teacher and are interested in CEU.&quot;)&nbsp;</li><li>UCI OCW site contains a link to P2PU (&quot;Want to study in a facilitated course? Sign-up opens 18 November&quot;)</li></ul></li><li>Peers can enroll in the course on P2PU and work through the content together with the social support and learning</li><li>For those that opted to study with others for credit, P2PU will provide evidence of their interaction, participation and learning to UCI for the credit</li></ul><br><strong><u>Flowchart</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Visitors to UCI OCW site are offered to join P2PU course. Visitor coming through P2PU site are offered to optionally register for credits with UCI.</li><li>Students enroll in P2PU course</li><li>Two pathways:<ul class="bullet"><li>Noncredit:<ul class="bullet"><li>Students take the P2PU course and work through the content with peers</li></ul></li><li>For credit:<ul class="bullet"><li>Student registers with UCI and opts into sharing P2PU data with UCI</li><li>Students take the P2PU course and work through the content with peers</li><li>P2PU tracks participation metrics and course activity and displays in a dashboard accessible to UCI</li><li>At the end of the course&#x2F;study group, UCI reviews the dashboard and determines if credit should be awarded (optional: additional review, exam, testing)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><strong><u>Evidence P2PU could provide (on user dashboard):</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Participation metrics<ul class="bullet"><li>Site log ins</li><li>Time spent logged into course</li><li>Posts&#x2F;Responses in discussions</li><li>Other</li></ul></li><li>Course organizer ratings&#x2F;sign off - summative feedback from the course organizer on the student&#x27;s performance in the course<ul class="bullet"><li>NOTE: for the pilot, we could have UCI instructors lead the courses on P2PU and thus add additional weight&#x2F;validity to this evidence. However, we would like to design the model in a way that can scale beyond UCI instructor involvement.</li></ul></li><li>Student work produced within the course</li><li>Potentially: Social evidence including peer assessments and endorsements</li></ul><br><strong><u>Open Questions&#x2F;Challenges:</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>What evidence UCI feels is necessary to award credit</li><li>How P2PU and UCI shares information about user registration &#x2F; confirms email addresses</li><li>UCI courses currently have embedded quizzes that are not as easy to replicate in the P2PU environment (would take additional development). Do we need to integrate the UCI quizzes on the P2PU side? Is the evidence outlined above enough for credit without the quizzes?</li></ul><br><strong><u>Additional&#x2F;Future Opportunities:</u></strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Incorporating Social Evidence: P2PU can provide evidence around social aspects, adding more layers of evidence such as endorsements, peer badges or peer reviews that can make the PD evidence more robust</li><li>Badges: As P2PU builds out its assessment and badge program, the badges will eventually be the core evidence to demonstrate participation, skill and learning back to UCI. P2PU will be exploring this more in 2012 and can build it in when ready.</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong><u>Opportunity:</u></strong><br>UCI can leverage P2PU to give professional development students the opportunity to extend the value of their PD work. Through the P2PU social learning platform, UCI could offer their students the opportunity to study for the CSET exam and work through PD content with a group of people with similar goals. This could extend the value of these PD experiences by deepening the learning, increasing attention and participation and providing more opportunities for networking and mentorship than one experiences by working through the content alone on the UCI extension site. Leveraging this opportunity even further, students could choose to simply study with others and participate in a P2PU study group&#x2F;course, or they could choose to study with others for credit, which would mean that P2PU would provide evidence of participation and learning within the course to UCI and UCI would grant them credit towards CPE&#x27;s for the time spent and work done in the P2PU environment.<br><br></body>
