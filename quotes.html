<body>Quotes that we can use in the showcase&#x2F;homepage.<br><br>Include links to sources<br><br><br><br>Thanks for the link-age :) Personally, this course has been a real fire-starter for me. I came in pretty blind and I was not expecting to find this study group as fascinating or as pertinent as it is (that&#x27;s definitely a good thing!). Our discussions have pushed me to take the dive from aggregating to more explicit curation.<br><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;comments&#x2F;19878&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;comments&#x2F;19878&#x2F;</a><br><br><br>Comment from rodrigo<br><br><em>I love the system P2PU use in the courses available, mostly online courses you just listen or watch but you guys make us be part of, feels like in a real class room</em><br><br><em>Thank you for the great job guys!!</em><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;messages&#x2F;reply&#x2F;46239&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;messages&#x2F;reply&#x2F;46239&#x2F;</a><br><br><br><em>&quot;I have found p2pu to be the best learning experience I have ever done. I&#x27;ve done lots of formal and informal study but the level of participation in these courses is amazing. The diversity of the groups experience really has added a very rich thread to my learning and keeps me coming back for more.&quot;</em><br><strong>Quote from a School of Ed participant and Facilitator (July 2012)</strong><br><br><br>Comment from&nbsp;<br>cmr987 taking HTML in the world around you<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;creative&#x2d;presentation&#x2F;submissions&#x2F;140&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;badges&#x2F;creative-presentation&#x2F;submissions&#x2F;140&#x2F;</a><br><br><em>I&#x27;ve spent some time wandering around my house and taking pictures, trying to view the scenes I see every day with fresh eyes.&nbsp; Thinking outside the box on this exercise has not only stretched and challenged me, but it&#x27;s allowed the new HTML tags I&#x27;ve learned to become second nature to me in a very natural and fun way.</em><br><em>I put a lot of effort into finding creative examples, and into documenting those examples so others can perhaps learn from what I&#x27;ve done or become inspired as they do their own learning.</em><br><br><br><br>Comment from learner Franklin Chen in Writing for the Web - <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;writing&#x2d;for&#x2d;the&#x2d;web&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;writing-for-the-web&#x2F;</a><br><br>&quot;<em>What I have learned and applied, </em>based on my own reading habits, is helping the reader by putting in a lot of headers to break up text into manageable chunks that can be scanned easily. This is one way in which my writing has changed with the times. Even if I were to write a full-length book, I would put in these navigational aids.&quot;<br><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>&quot;Well, a week ago I had no idea what DNS is, how to register a Domain Name or how to publish a website.
