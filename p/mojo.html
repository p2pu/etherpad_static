<body><strong>MoJo Learning Labs on P2PU.org</strong><br><br>MoJo: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;drumbeat&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2d;US&#x2F;projects&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drumbeat.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;projects&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;</a><br><br>Logistics<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Dates: July 11 - August 5</li><li>Approximately 60 participants (and many followers as course will be well publicised)</li></ul><br>Requirements Update:<br><br>+ Notifications: Last time, each user was set by default to receive all&nbsp; notifications. Ideally, I&#x27;d like all of our users by default to receive&nbsp; _only_ notifications from course administrators, or when course&nbsp; administrators post to the course pages. Perhaps this could be an option&nbsp; when creating a course? (Alternately, as suggested on <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;mojo">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;mojo</a>&nbsp; there could be an option for daily digest that was on by default, then&nbsp; notifications could stay the same -- **but** broadcast messages from&nbsp; admins would still need to go through immediately.)<br><ul class="bullet"><li>groups need settings on off by default to choose to: set participants default notifications settings as: digest, only send notifications from group organizers, send important updates inmediatedly (this last one should be the default for all groups, but the other two can)</li></ul><br>+ Tasks: Tasks are a neat idea, but I&#x27;m concerned that it is not clear&nbsp; that creating a task is &#x2F; can be equivalent to creating a new discussion&nbsp; thread. I&#x27;d like to encourage participants to create new topics for&nbsp; discussion, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d want them adding new Tasks that&nbsp; are visible at the top of the course page -- ideally, Tasks would be&nbsp; reserved for the administrators to post. No concrete suggestion here...&nbsp; but would welcome ideas. We need a way to have group discussions and I&#x27;m&nbsp; loath to use Google Groups (just adds one more system into the mix;&nbsp; possibly creating confusion).<br><br>+ Course material: I&#x27;m guessing that Tasks should also be used for&nbsp; course material? Or is there another recommended process for posting&nbsp; non-actionable information for participants? Perhaps on the &#x27;Full&nbsp; Description&#x27; page? Either way, it would be great to have some guidance&nbsp; on this -- for example, where should &#x2F; would we post recorded video&nbsp; lectures along with their slides and chat log?<br><br>Otherwise, our current plan is to run the application process using&nbsp; Mozilla&#x27;s system for privacy policy reasons. We&#x27;ll then ask you to help&nbsp; us create accounts on P2PU for the people who we&#x27;d like to register.&nbsp; Ideally, we&#x27;d be able to upload their photo and bio while we&#x27;re creating&nbsp; their account, so there would be little need to chase them down to fill&nbsp; out their profile.<br><br>Once the course gets underway, it will be crucial to be able to e-mail&nbsp; them reminders about lectures, assignments, and so on. So it would be&nbsp; great to know if A) the notification system (from course admins -&gt;&nbsp; participants) is more robust than it was previously (can I send HTML?),&nbsp; and B) if the deliverability of those messages is high (not going to&nbsp; junk folders, etc.).<br><br>General:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Are there drumbeat.org developers that could help with some of this? (Zuzel is more realistic than Philipp Schmidt, and cautious about over promising ;-)<ul class="bullet"><li>Specifically wondering about &quot;challenges&quot; feature in drumbeat.org that might help us with some of the sign-up tasks - but would need to be implemented as a general feature (currently just implemented for one group in drumbeat)</li></ul></li><li>P2PU Development tracker - <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2d;lernanta&#x2F;overview">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002-lernanta&#x2F;overview</a></li></ul><br>Features&#x2F; Functionality:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Discussion<ul class="bullet"><li>Feature Request -&gt; Ability for participants to start a new discussion<ul class="bullet"><li><em>Every participant can create a new &quot;task&quot; but it&#x27;s not obvious that those work like discussions.
