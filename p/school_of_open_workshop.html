Participants will learn how to teach someone&nbsp; something open content, by finding, using, and sharing open content on&nbsp; the web. Participants will also make (and in the process learn how to&nbsp; design effectively) what they taught into a P2PU course.&nbsp;<br><br>The session will be split up into three parts: 1) Introductory&nbsp; exercises, 2) Taking an open challenge, and 3) Building the results into&nbsp; a School of Open course.&nbsp;<br><br>In 1) participants will become familiar with the School of Open, context, philosophy, guidelines.&nbsp;<br>In 2) participants will learn how to Teach someone something with open content&nbsp; by taking the challenge in breakout groups. Participants will then&nbsp; rotate groups for Round Robin teaching&#x2F;learning. The skills learned in&nbsp; this activity: Finding, using, and sharing open content on the web.&nbsp;<br>In 3) participants will assemble, edit, and adapt the resources&nbsp; they found in 2) to create a School of Open challenge or course,&nbsp; following School of Open guidelines and the 30 minute challenge of making a course.&nbsp; Skills learned: Designing an effective peer learning challenge&#x2F;course.&nbsp; If there is time, participants will also identify the skills (and&nbsp; potential badges) learned in their course.&nbsp;<br><br>A group of 5 would remain as one or two groups of 2 and 3; a larger&nbsp; group would be broken up into groups of 3-5, depending on interest.&nbsp;<br><br>The introductory exercises should take at most half an hour;&nbsp; participants will be teaching each other well into the second part of&nbsp; the session (which I estimate will occur at 1 to 1.5 hours). Total&nbsp; session time should be ~3 hours.&nbsp;<br><br>Several new courses created as part of School of Open&nbsp; with relevant skills mapped; constructive feedback&#x2F;ways to improve&nbsp; existing courses, especially Teach Someone Something with Open Content;&nbsp; feedback to improve the School of Open guidelines; and several new&nbsp; course creators joining the School of Open community.&nbsp;<br><br><br>= October Meeting for funders&#x2F;&quot;open&quot; domain leads (Palo Alto 5 October) =&nbsp;<br><br><em>School of Open</em><br><strong>A School of Open Workshop (Leads: Jane &amp; Philipp)</strong><br>Universal&nbsp; access to and participation in research, education, and culture is made&nbsp; possible by &#8220;openness&#8221;, but not enough people know what &quot;open&quot; means or&nbsp; how to take advantage of it. The School of Open is a collaboration&nbsp; between Creative Commons and the Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) to create&nbsp; a learning community focused on &#8220;open&#8221; standards, tools, and practices&nbsp; and their practical application in life and society. The workshop will&nbsp; gather key representatives from different &#8220;open&#8221; sectors to focus the&nbsp; initiative and start with concrete first steps. We hope to develop a&nbsp; skills map, compile a set of initial subject areas, identify partner&nbsp; organizations and initiatives, list existing materials and content and&nbsp; plan the key milestones for year 1.
