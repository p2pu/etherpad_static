<body><strong>= Guidelines for a School of Open course =</strong><br>Below are some questions to think about in creating a School of Open course.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What course are you interested in creating as part of the School of Open?&nbsp;</strong><br>When&nbsp; you think about creating a course, ask yourself, &quot;What do I want to&nbsp; help people DO?&quot; versus &quot;What do I think people should know or learn?&quot;&nbsp; For example, I want to help:<br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>my little cousin get a better grade in Algebra</li><li>teachers and educators find free, useful resources online</li><li>academics share their research and data</li><li>photographers get broader exposure for their work&nbsp;</li><li>filmmakers find music for their videos</li><li>legislators develop laws with greater public input</li><li>musicians remix songs</li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>How can open content, tools, or processes help people do what they do better?</strong><br>Open practices include <em>using</em> the content, tools and processes shared with us, <em>enabling</em> others to use, share and adapt what we create, and <em>supporting</em>&nbsp; transparency in our content, tools and processes. If a course involves&nbsp; teaching or learning about any of these practices, either broadly or in a&nbsp; particular field, then it probably fits in the School of Open.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Is there a specific aspect or mechanism that keeps people from taking advantage of open stuff?</strong><br>Think&nbsp; about the key obstacles that discourage someone from learning about&nbsp; openness, applying open tools, or sharing their work openly. For&nbsp; example, what might cast doubt into a musician&#x27;s mind when it comes to&nbsp; using openly licensed material? Why might a graphics designer refrain&nbsp; from sharing her&#x2F;his works openly? Are there good reasons for not going&nbsp; fully open or are certain misconceptions playing a role?<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Getting started</strong><br><ol class="number"><li>Go to <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;schoolofopen&#x2e;org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;schoolofopen.org</a> and get familiar with the other courses to see how yours might be structured.</li><li>Join the discussion and introduce yourself and your field of &#8220;open&#8221; interest: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;groups&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;group&#x2F;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;open">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;group&#x2F;school-of-open</a>. See if others are interested in building it as well. Someone might already be developing a similar course.</li><li>Register for a P2PU account at <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org</a>.</li><li>Start creating! You can create directly on the P2PU platform or use <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org</a>&nbsp; for planning and collaborative editing. When you&#x27;re at a point that&#x27;s&nbsp; ready for feedback, email the discussion list at&nbsp; school-of-open@googlegroups.com for community review. More about our&nbsp; course review process at <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;p&#x2F;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;open&#x2d;course&#x2d;review">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;school-of-open-course-review</a>&nbsp;</li></ol>&nbsp;<br><strong>= Course creation support =</strong><br>Below are some resources and additional exercises that others have found helpful for developing their courses.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Take a course on how to make a course!&nbsp;</strong><br>The&nbsp; first step to creating a successful P2PU course is to identify the&nbsp; skills your peers will learn. In the School of Open context, the skill&nbsp; involves some aspect of openness, such as finding open content, sharing&nbsp; media, CC licensing, remixing music, or editing Wikipedia. Learn how to&nbsp; make a course in half an hour:&nbsp;<br><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;make&#x2d;a&#x2d;course&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;make-a-course&#x2F;</a><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Who are you trying to help? Think about the course from the learner&#x27;s standpoint.&nbsp;</strong><br>Who&nbsp; will be taking the course? What real world questions is s&#x2F;he likely to&nbsp; ask? What needs is s&#x2F;he likely to have and barriers s&#x2F;he is likely to&nbsp; run into?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Create a user scenario:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Draw the person you are trying to help.</li><li>List 3 questions (or more) that person would ask or list 3 problems s&#x2F;he needs help solving.</li><li>Describe that person&#x27;s situation in a few sentences or short paragraph, either out loud written down.<ul class="indent"><li><em>Example</em>:&nbsp; Till Matheson is a professional photographer. He sells most of his work&nbsp; to advertising agencies. One of his specialities is the mashing-up of&nbsp; different images (using Photoshop). He not only uses his own photos to&nbsp; creates these collages, but often includes photos he finds on the web or&nbsp; in old magazines. He wants to know what the legal regulations are that&nbsp; govern the use of this content - he doesn&#x27;t want to get in trouble or&nbsp; have to pay royalties. He is also interested in sharing his work with&nbsp; more people online, to increase his audience and find more customers,&nbsp; but he is concerned that someone may take one of his photos and use it&nbsp; commercially without compensating him. He wants to better understand&nbsp; what tools &amp; practices other photographers use and how openly&nbsp; sharing affects his business model.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Visual examples of more user scenarios: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;flickr&#x2e;com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;p2puniversity&#x2F;sets&#x2F;72157631786592049&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;p2puniversity&#x2F;sets&#x2F;72157631786592049&#x2F;</a></li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>What can you reuse and build on?</strong><br>Do&nbsp; openly licensed resources already exist that explain&#x2F;teach any of this?&nbsp; Are people already teaching or learning about related topics elsewhere&nbsp; that you can tap to collectively build the course?<br><ul class="bullet"><li>You don&#x27;t have to start from scratch; adapt existing courses&#x2F;resources to your audience: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pad&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;p&#x2F;school&#x2d;of&#x2d;open&#x2d;resources">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.p2pu.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;school-of-open-resources</a></li></ul>&nbsp;<br><strong>Document your thinking behind the course and learning activities</strong><br>The learner may ask, why am I doing this? What am I learning? Be transparent about the learning objectives.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>= FEEDBACK on the Guidelines above =&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Add your comment, suggested change here... or if you&#x27;re comfortable, edit directly above!</li><li>John&nbsp; Weitzmann, CC Germany Legal: oops, edited right in the text above :-)&nbsp; Repasted here: In&nbsp; order to keep a course focused and value the skills&nbsp; learners already&nbsp; have when starting the course, think about where and&nbsp; why the key&nbsp; obstacles are that keep people from applying open tools,&nbsp; from investing&nbsp; time into learning about open and also maybe from&nbsp; reflecting on openness&nbsp; at all. Instead of giving the learners the grand&nbsp; tour of a specific&nbsp; topic with a lot of theoretical background, it is&nbsp; sometimes better to&nbsp; focus on key aspects.&nbsp;</li></ul>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></body>
