<body><strong><u>Idea for a Symposium at the NLC</u></strong><br><br>There is much discussion these days of the idea that personal learning environments (PLEs) and Open Learning Networks (OLN) (Mott &amp; Wiley, 2009) could help institutions, teachers, and learners break off with a transmissionist approach to learning, and embrace a more social approach (see e.g., Mott, 2010; Weller, 2010; Fiedler &amp; Pata, 2009; Mott &amp; Wiley, 2009; Downes, 2005).&nbsp;<br><br>These technologies are said to move away from the metaphor of the classroom model embodied in Course Management Systems (CMS) and built on central areas of expertise, such as subject-matter authorities represented by teachers; enacted by way of filtering of knowledge through recognized outlets; and reproduced via institutionalized assessment procedures (Weinberger, 2007).&nbsp; Strong claims emerge from the debate, such as: the need to move from &#8220;content distribution&#8221; to &#8220;educational content as a campfire around which learners gather&#8221; (Mott &amp;Wiley, 2009), with the aim of making learners&nbsp; &quot;knowledge-able&quot; rather than &quot;knowledgeable&quot; (Wesch, 2009).&nbsp; CMS are supposed to use and integrate with many of the Web 2.0 tools that students already use freely on the Internet and that they expect to find in this kind of system, and move towards decentralized PLEs (Agee and Yang, 2009);&nbsp; the Internet and a growing host of Open Educational Resources (OER) are declaring &#8220;openness&#8221; the necessary default and challenging centralized and closed-access CMS (Batson, Paharia, &amp; Kumar, 2008). Manifestations of openness include teachers becoming facilitators in multivocal and multicentered learning spaces, instead of playing the role of knowledge filter; publishing being freed of many traditional gate-keepers; abundance of formal and informal educational resources, and educational design principles trying to be open to multiple possible users and uses (Batson, Paharia, &amp; Kumar, 2008).&nbsp;<br><br>In this symposium, we invite scholars and practitioners to analyze the contents of this discussion, with the aim to question the main claims made about centralization and decentralization of online learning environments -- and to analyze the nature of the debate itself.&nbsp; As organizers of this symposium, we contend that the debate is not yet empirically and theoretically informed, and we suggest that a more critical approach is needed to investigate the push towards decentralized and open learning environments and their implications for learners.<br><br>There are nevertheless a number of practical experiments from which topics could be drawn:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)</li><li>free&#x2F;open online &quot;universities&quot; (e.g., Wikiversity; Peer-to-Peer University (P2PU))</li><li>Domain-specific collaborative environments with a pedagogical slant (like PlanetMath)</li><li>Open production environments linked to formal education (e.g. OpenLearn, OLNet, SocialLearn)</li><li>For-fee online courses using twitter, blogs, tumblr etc. as a platform (e.g. Howard Rheingold&#x27;s &quot;Rheingold U&quot;)</li></ul><br>We encourage submissions that critically evaluate claims about the abundance of accessible resources, participation in content production, and social connections built upon shared interests, in terms of &quot;movement&quot;-level outcomes as well as learning outcomes.<br><br>A sense of impending crisis of the centralized and closed-access CMS predominant in Higher Education pervades this debate. However, the actual situation is far from clear.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>References</strong><br><br>Agee, A.S., Yang, C. and the 2009 EDUCAUSE Current Issues Committee (2009).
