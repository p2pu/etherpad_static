<body><strong>Marisa&#x27;s comments:</strong><br><br><em>Meaning&nbsp; of terms: do you use the term crowdsourcing to refer to&nbsp; peer-production? Do you think the two terms can be used interchangeably?&nbsp; Some do, but I am not sure. I suggest this paper: Open Source Software Collaboration: Foundational Concepts and an Empirical Analysis, at </em><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;scientificcommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;50121986"><em><u>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.scientificcommons.org&#x2F;50121986</u></em></a><em>, if you have not read it yet. It might be useful for the definitions of concepts.</em><br><br><em>Commons-based peer production</em>: production organized on a voluntary basis rather than via firms or markets.<br><br><em>Peer Production</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Benkler uses this as a more general term than CBPP; &quot;peer production&quot;&nbsp; that could describe the activities that take place within a firm that has&nbsp;&nbsp; been organized in a certain way (e.g. a team of people work together as&nbsp;&nbsp; peers to create a given product which they then sell).&nbsp; In any case&nbsp; the&nbsp; emphasis here is on the peers, not on the common resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; &quot;barn&nbsp; raising&quot; is the prototypical example in this category (here the&nbsp;&nbsp; community works together to co-create a barn primarily for use by one&nbsp;&nbsp; homestead).&nbsp; One might say that the peer relationship is itself a&nbsp;&nbsp; common-pool resource, but at least if we look at things in a simple&nbsp; way,&nbsp; it isn&#x27;t itself being &quot;produced&quot;, but, rather, applied to produce&nbsp;&nbsp; something else.<br><br><em>Crowdsourcing</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going the other direction, I think crowdsourcing can take on more&nbsp;&nbsp; market-like characteristics.&nbsp; E.g. in the PlanetMath setting, we could&nbsp;&nbsp; create a market where people to pay for tutoring or marking of papers,&nbsp;&nbsp; on the condition that we get to re-use the materials that the tutors&nbsp;&nbsp; produce.&nbsp; At the same time, I don&#x27;t think that money necessarily *has*&nbsp;&nbsp; to change hands in crowdsourcing.<br><br><em>My use of these terms</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that CBPP can itself see money changing hands, e.g. firms paying&nbsp;&nbsp; other firms for software development, so long as the software is&nbsp;&nbsp; contributed to a commons.&nbsp; I would say ultimately that the crucial&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;difference&quot; between CBPP and crowdsourcing is the question of who owns&nbsp;&nbsp; the resource at the end of the day (think of the difference between&nbsp; Wikipedia and Amazon.com).&nbsp; If the resource is a common&nbsp; resource, then&nbsp; CBPP is a better (i.e., more precise) term.&nbsp; That said,&nbsp; since the&nbsp; resources I&#x27;m talking about in my proposal *are* commons-type&nbsp;&nbsp; resources, &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; was for me simply a shorthand for&nbsp; &quot;commons-based&nbsp; peer production&quot;.&nbsp; (There are some further subtleties:&nbsp; If we&#x27;re talking&nbsp; about a &quot;personal&quot; learning environment, e.g. for&nbsp; privacy or other&nbsp; reasons, maybe that isn&#x27;t useful to think of as a&nbsp; commons-type resource,&nbsp; even if it is formed through engagement with a&nbsp; broader commons.)<br><br><em>P.&nbsp; 4: It would be interesting if you elaborated a bit more as to why it is&nbsp; important to overcome the &#8220;learner centric&#8221; model so popular these&nbsp; days. Why is it important? I think that readers would appreciate to know&nbsp; the theoretical or other reasons underpinning this argument! I&nbsp; personally failed to connect this statement to the preceding sentence&nbsp; where you talk about the need for a multi-level adaptability.</em><br><br>I&#x27;m glad I delayed answering this question until today!&nbsp; This is similar to the difference between&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>&quot;paragogy&quot; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;metameso&#x2e;org&#x2F;&#x7e;joe&#x2F;docs&#x2F;paragogy&#x2d;final&#x2e;pdf">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;metameso.org&#x2F;~joe&#x2F;docs&#x2F;paragogy-final.pdf</a> and&nbsp;</li><li>&quot;heutagogy&quot; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;ultibase&#x2e;rmit&#x2e;edu&#x2e;au&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;dec00&#x2F;hase2&#x2e;htm">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ultibase.rmit.edu.au&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;dec00&#x2F;hase2.htm</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>(I only found out about heutagogy after the paragogy paper was already submitted!)<br><br>The&nbsp; way I see it now is that paragogy is focused on &quot;context&quot;, i.e. on&nbsp; creating a useful context for learning.&nbsp; On the other&nbsp; hand, heutagogy&nbsp; is meant to be a theory of self-directed, <strong>self-determined</strong>, learning. I don&#x27;t see heutagogy and paragogy as being in conflict precisely, but that said, a supportive learning context has a lot more to it than just individual learners working in a self-directed fashion. This is similar to McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot; idea, and also similar to the following idea (this is a quote I left out of the paragogy paper because of space constraints): &quot;[<em>T]he traditional Theravada view of the various stages of progression toward eventual enlightenment are broadened to include the society of which the individual is inextricably a part. One cannot pursue one&#x27;s own enlightenment without pursuing equally that of the village&#x27;s, and first their mundane suffering of poverty and hardship must be addressed.&quot;</em> -- <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;ccbs&#x2e;ntu&#x2e;edu&#x2e;tw&#x2F;FULLTEXT&#x2F;JR&#x2d;EPT&#x2F;gbar&#x2e;htm">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccbs.ntu.edu.tw&#x2F;FULLTEXT&#x2F;JR-EPT&#x2F;gbar.htm</a><br><br><em>Motivation&nbsp; (p. 6). My take on motivation is influenced by activity theory&nbsp; (Engestr&#246;m). In Engestr&#246;m&#8217;s theory of expansive learning, motives and&nbsp; motivations are not be sought inside individual subjects, but they are in the object to be expanded and changed. The object is both a material entity that makes resistance = contradiction, and the purpose of an activity = solving the contradiction. The object is the true&nbsp; carrier of the motive of the activity. Of course this position is by no&nbsp; means better than the one you have taken, but it helps think of the&nbsp; learner not as an individual but as a part of a system, and see problems not just in the gap between individual intentions and realizations, but&nbsp; in the whole activity system which each learning peer constitutes.</em><br><br>Yeah, I like this view, and it seems consistent with the context-centered focus that paragogy talks about.&nbsp; I&#x27;ll be curious to see if I&#x2F;we can further sort out the difference between &quot;object&quot; and &quot;context&quot;.&nbsp; (BTW, I have requested the Engestr&#246;m book you recommended from the library -- someone else has it checked out currently; I hope they return it soon!)<br><br><em>SECI&nbsp; model. I would elaborate a bit more on the reasons for this choice. It&nbsp; is not entirely clear to me what you have gained from using this model.&nbsp; Is it the same SECI developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi, by the way?</em><br><br>So, yes, this is the standard SECI model, though I use slightly different terminology to make things simpler.&nbsp; (Socialization is replaced with &quot;what I do in this context&quot;, Externalization is replaced with &quot;What we do in this context&quot;, Combination is replaced with &quot;What we do it with in this context&quot;, and Internalization is replaced with &quot;What it&#x27;s all about&quot; -- or even more simply, the shorthand <em>I, We, Its, It</em> -- from Ken Wilber: An Integral Theory of Consciousness, Journal of Consciousness Studies, 4(1), (1997) pp. 71--92.) A typical application for me is to describe a given context in terms of roles, e.g. here&#x27;s what I had to say about the role of a <em>facilitator</em> at P2PU:<br><br><em>I&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; come up with a course I&#x27;d like to facilitate, and then facilitate it<br><em>We </em>discuss ideas about how our courses might work and what &quot;facilitation&quot; means (e.g. as opposed to &quot;teaching&quot;)<br><em>Its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> discussions on a community mailing list and other settings (including discussions with participants in the course as it runs)<br><em>It&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; helps me improve my skills at a course designer and facilitator (and it&#x27;s fun talking about and practising this stuff!)<br>(page 18 of the submitted version of the report)<br><br>Now as for how exactly this sort of thing is *useful*... #1 I&#x27;ll definitely look forward to seeing the Engestr&#246;m critique, #2 I do have another book chapter in progress that will develop my approach further... my very initial grappling with the ideas might be informative, it&#x27;s in this talk: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;metameso&#x2e;org&#x2F;&#x7e;joe&#x2F;docs&#x2F;crowdsourcing&#x2d;education&#x2e;pdf">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;metameso.org&#x2F;~joe&#x2F;docs&#x2F;crowdsourcing-education.pdf</a><br><br><em>About&nbsp; the use of a survey of the &#8220;wished for&#8221; topics (p. 18).&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it a bit&nbsp; of rationalistic slant here? I mean it reminds me a bit of a&nbsp; rationalistic approach to computer design as a process of transforming a&nbsp; representation from a requirement through design specifications. I am&nbsp; influenced by Lucy Suchman here, and I think that a list of wished for&nbsp; course topics could be used just as a roadmap and it is probably useful&nbsp; only at this level, but not much for planning the details of actions of&nbsp; the peers. Because, as Suchman would probably argue, the &#8220;wished for&#8221;&nbsp; topic is going to interact with the unique circumstances in which the&nbsp; course experience is happening. So, it is necessary to account not only&nbsp; for the topics that peers report to be interested in (perhaps even&nbsp; without much awareness of what they really want to learn, as you also&nbsp; say), but also for the circumstances (with respect to what happens in&nbsp; the course and in P2PU, as well as their subjective experiences of&nbsp; problems and opportunities).</em><br><br>I think balance is useful.&nbsp; At the extreme of no prior knowledge about participants (no &quot;organizational memory&quot; primarily because nothing had happened yet), we have something like DIY Math -- survey people&#x27;s interests on the fly and try to accomodate them.&nbsp; That MIGHT work out if it was combined with some cool ways to support&#x2F;generate commitment.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#x27;m afraid people will just drift away.&nbsp; Then there&#x27;s something in the middle, like using an informal survey that turns into partial course designs, starting from my report&#x27;s appendix on Some interests of &quot;DIY Math&quot; participants and turning into the sketches at <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikiversity&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;User&#x3a;Arided">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiversity.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;User:Arided</a>...&nbsp; but these sketches don&#x27;t say anything about how the courses themselves will run, they&#x27;re like &quot;skeletons&quot; and even the &quot;bones&quot; can be rearranged.&nbsp; I completely agree with you that the challenge is also to account for circumstances!!&nbsp; Perhaps &quot;wished for&quot; topics could be gleaned from looking at what people say in their learner profiles, where such wishes would be combined with various statements about commitment and so on.<br><br></body>
