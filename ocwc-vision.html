<body>A Vision for Open Education<br><br>Brainstorm by the OCWC board ...&nbsp;<br><br>6 May 2011<br><br>Everything is open? Everyone is sharing? What does the OCWC do in the middle of an environment where everything is open? The consortium might become obsolete.<br><br>Center of gravity of the movement will move from one global consortium, into regional consortia.&nbsp;<br><br>Just-in time, and lifelong, learning will be the norm and crucial.<br><br>We have content, we have connectivity, we need to find solutions for the human system. The consortium should hunt for the solution for this human system.<br><br>All governments will by default require all resources to be published openly. All institutions will publish openly by default. Open will be the default.&nbsp;<br><br>If we find the solution for the human system, and we have all materials open, we will reach a point where learning will be a natural part of life, fun, and everyone will do it all the time.&nbsp;<br><br>All education will be open - teachers, students, self-learners contributing.&nbsp;<br><br>OCWC will be &quot;the&quot; organization that coordinates the open education community.&nbsp;<br><br></body>
