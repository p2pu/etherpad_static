Meetings in Toronto (Zuzel, Stian, Philipp, and Paul Osman) and&nbsp;&nbsp; San Francisco (Alison, Erin, John, Philipp, with Zuzel on skype) to&nbsp; talk&nbsp; through all the main features we need for April, and the ideas we&nbsp; have&nbsp; for our platform for beyond.</li><li>A: Lots of changes coming in the new site, which will knock out a lot of the problems with the drupal site.</li><li>A: Current site claims to be a place for peer-to-peer learning, but is actually just a poor interface for traditional courses.&nbsp;</li><li>A:&nbsp; New&nbsp; p2pu.org is about study groups and forming them around a topic.&nbsp; These&nbsp; groups do &quot;stuff&quot; around tasks, which are the spaces where&nbsp; activity&nbsp; takes place.&nbsp;</li><li>P: Study groups can have an intended start date, but are not tied as strictly tied into rounds anymore.&nbsp;</li><li>A:&nbsp; Anyone&nbsp; can follow anything (school group, task, person) but to&nbsp; particiapte you&nbsp; do have to sign up. There is no sign-up &quot;task&quot; but&nbsp; anyone signing up&nbsp; for a study group has to answer 2 basic questions:&nbsp; &quot;Why have you signed&nbsp; up&quot; &amp; &quot;What would you like to learn&quot;.&nbsp; Organisers then accpet&#x2F;deny&nbsp; people on the basis of these answers, but&nbsp; once they&#x27;ve been accepted,&nbsp; their answers become public.&nbsp;</li><li>A:&nbsp; Course&nbsp; organisers: What do you call an organiser now, and how much&nbsp; authority&nbsp; do they have (at the basic minimum)? A person who creates a&nbsp; group and&nbsp; tasks and allows people into the group&nbsp;</li><li>Pippa: How do &quot;experts&quot; prove their expertise?&nbsp; referring to ranking of group &quot;creator&quot; being queried at study group creation.</li><li>Alison:&nbsp;&nbsp; When an individual fills in the form, they express their own level of&nbsp;&nbsp; expertise - we can hope that people will tend to not claim expertise.&nbsp;</li><li>Pippa: Ranking of skills might be more effective if badges are being used as the metric</li><li>Philipp:&nbsp;&nbsp; right now, we have no way of measuring the skill level of the people&nbsp;&nbsp; who start courses, but it is assumed that you need to be an expert and&nbsp;&nbsp; this probably prevents a lot of peer-to-peer learning from taking&nbsp;&nbsp; place.&nbsp;</li><li>Philipp: what happens in the study group is really important and experts can be terrible facilitators</li><li>Pippa: How would study groups branch? And how do we track this and see how the groupings emerge?&nbsp;</li><li>Bekka: would a course be one big task or would it be a series of tasks?&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>P:&nbsp;&nbsp; Study group creators have freedom to decide this (structure), but&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially a study group is very much like a course on the level, and&nbsp;&nbsp; tasks are realized learning goals&#x2F;activities within in</li><li>P: Perhaps groups could create more tasks within the original framework as they go</li></ul></li><li>How will meetings be managed?

Then&nbsp; we can at least get the people who didn&#x27;t get&nbsp; into the course, even&nbsp; though we don&#x27;t get everyone&#x27;s opinions (those&nbsp; who didn&#x27;t sign-up).<ul class="bullet"><li>Did you sign--up for any courses?</li><li>were you accepted into a course?</li><li>additional questions we can ask after this?&nbsp; &lt;--- HELP?</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>Lighthouse</strong><br>Should we all start using it?<br>Bekka, Ali, Philipp and Zuzel all enjoy it.

Mix&nbsp; of hard&#x2F;soft skills? I would hope so, but not sure we were focused on&nbsp; jobs specifically in that.<ul class="bullet"><li>Hm,&nbsp; maybe we should rethink this then since I think jobs should be the main&nbsp; driver.&nbsp; That&#x27;s fine - I think there might be some courses &#x2F; skills&nbsp; that are&nbsp; useful to have that we can&#x27;t directly map to jobs, but agree&nbsp; that the&nbsp; main focus, especially for the things we give badges for,&nbsp; should map&nbsp; back to jobs. What&#x27;s the best place to look at that?

I am planning to ask Pippa to look&nbsp; into that.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>This&nbsp;&nbsp; might mean looking very closely at our materials as well -&nbsp;&nbsp; formatting&#x2F;organisation&#x2F;location are all things that we&#x27;d need to&nbsp;&nbsp; consider.&nbsp;</li><li>Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; - and we don&#x27;t want the courses to become boring institutional, this&nbsp; is&nbsp; (could be) an opportunity to build something that is much better&nbsp; than&nbsp; what is currently used for courses in community colleges.&nbsp;</li><li>Absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp; - this could be a great opportunity to NOT do what a lot of the OER&nbsp;&nbsp; resource collections are currently doing, and just be amazing.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><br><br><strong>14 March 2011 - Roadmap Planning</strong><br><br><strong>Planning for April</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Use&nbsp;&nbsp;

All new course proposals should also have&nbsp;&nbsp; their owner added to p2pu-new-courses, and the list should also receive&nbsp; a&nbsp; notification.
