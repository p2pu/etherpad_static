If you are not able to participate you will still have access to all course materials.<br><br>Courses begin following the 26th&nbsp; of January (a Wednesday), and sign-ups will close sometime before then, depending on the course.&nbsp;<br><br>Happy course shopping until then!<br>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Modifications to Course Creation Process</strong><br>Interested people can no longer submit proposals through the google doc. they&#x27;re now directed to the <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;create&#x2d;draft&#x2d;course&#x2d;panel">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;create-draft-course-panel</a> page<br>Google form now updated (with minimal text) - <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;viewform&#x3f;formkey&#x3d;dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ&#x23;gid&#x3d;0">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spreadsheets.google.com&#x2F;viewform?formkey=dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ#gid=0</a>&nbsp; &lt;&lt; Any feedback on better wording for this would be appreciated.<br><br>MATT TODO: I can&#x27;t update the Drumbeat copy of the FAQ can you make sure that all references to proposing a course are changed from the Google Spreadsheet and refer to <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;create&#x2d;draft&#x2d;course&#x2d;panel">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.org&#x2F;create-draft-course-panel</a>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>HOW?</strong><br><strong>0) Communicate the change in registration date</strong><br>1) Finalize the School of Webcraft January course list - waiting<br>2) Help course leaders get ready for Jan 26 - orientation, matt&#x27;s also making a blog post based on the email i sent course proposers.

We&#x27;re really excited to be able to present your&nbsp;&nbsp; course as part of our January round of free, participatory learning&nbsp;&nbsp; about open and standards-based web development.&nbsp;<br><br>Before&nbsp;&nbsp; we can remove your course from draft status to open your course to&nbsp;&nbsp; applications from learners, we need to make sure that you and your&nbsp;&nbsp; course are prepared.<br><br><strong>What Should You Do Next?</strong><br><strong>A) Join the Course Design Orientation</strong><br>Participating&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Course Design Orientation is a great way to find out more about&nbsp;&nbsp; facilitating peer-learning and to ask questions of past and present&nbsp;&nbsp; course organisers. Run by Peer 2 Peer University, this orientation&nbsp;&nbsp; provides general guidance about designing and managing learning&nbsp;&nbsp; groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Sign Up for the Course Design Orientation on P2PU.<br><br><strong>B) Start refining your Course Design</strong><br>As&nbsp; a general guide for organising P2PU courses, please read the Course&nbsp; Design Handbook. You should pay particular attention to the Course&nbsp; Checklist which provides an overview of the minimum information required&nbsp; to run your course.<br><br>For&nbsp;&nbsp; further examples of Webcraft courses, &quot;For the Love of $&quot; organised by&nbsp; Dan Diebolt is a well-prepared course design. His&nbsp; sign-up task is&nbsp; well-defined and he has prepared clear information about&nbsp; the proposed&nbsp; weekly topics, tasks and readings. The course also refers&nbsp; to openly&nbsp; licensed materials where available.<br><br><strong>Priority One: Define a Sign Up Task</strong><br>Sign&nbsp;&nbsp; up tasks help you determine which applicants have suitable&nbsp; prerequisite&nbsp; knowledge, motivation and an understanding of how the&nbsp; collaborative&nbsp; nature of peer learning works.&nbsp; All of these qualities&nbsp; are important for&nbsp; a positive peer learning experience.<br><br>To&nbsp;&nbsp; inform people about the peer-learning process and the P2PU project we&nbsp;&nbsp; recommend that you ask them to watch this video about P2PU&nbsp; and ask them&nbsp; to respond. For example, you can suggest that they define a personal&nbsp; learning goal and how they want to&nbsp; help their peer learners.<br><br>The&nbsp;&nbsp; technical tasks that you set need going to be relevant to the topic&nbsp;&nbsp; and prerequisites of&nbsp; your course. For specific advice on what type of&nbsp; tasks to set we suggest&nbsp; that you ask the School of Webcraft community&nbsp; via the p2pu-webcraft discussion list.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Priority Two: Map out the weekly topics</strong><br>Creating&nbsp;&nbsp; a weekly course plan in advance is informative for both you and the&nbsp;&nbsp; course participants. Over the next two weeks you can refine the plan&nbsp; and&nbsp; add more detail, but at this stage it is helpful to define what&nbsp; topics&nbsp; will be the focus of each week&#x27;s activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As&nbsp;&nbsp; P2PU and School of Webcraft operate in a peer-learning manner, you&nbsp;&nbsp; should ask for feedback on your course plan from both the Webcraft&nbsp;&nbsp; community and the peers you accept into your course. This allows you to&nbsp;&nbsp; collaborate on the structure of the course and to make adjustments&nbsp; where&nbsp; required. For example, one week may have too many readings and&nbsp; articles&nbsp; assigned to it and as a group you may choose to either make&nbsp; certain&nbsp; articles a lower priority, or you may choose to extend the&nbsp; course time.<br><br></body>
