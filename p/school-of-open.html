Offer skills and certification around &quot;openness&quot; that result in the spread of open tools, content, and practices.</em><br><br><strong><em>Scope</em></strong><br><br><em>Learning opportunities and certification offered by the School of Open focus exclusively on promoting open practices in research, education, and culture. As an example: courses that explain copyright in the context of open licensing are appropriate; courses that only explain the nuances of copyright law are not appropriate. This focus may evolve and deepen as the School of Open community grows.</em><br><br><em>Courses must be built around tools that are accessible to any learner free of cost, free to share, and free to modify to suit their personal needs. Participants should also be encouraged to openly share their work. Participants are expected to openly license their work under the CC Attribution-ShareAlike, or compatible license, so that they may review, revise, and adapt each others work.</em><br><br><strong><em>Structure</em></strong><br><br><em>The School of Open is operated by CC and P2PU in a spirit of goodwill and partnership, and eschews unnecessary bureaucracy. Decisions will be made in an open and transparent manner. (we may have to revisit &quot;partnership&quot; unless it is an official partnership, which this sounds like it is. if it&#x27;s an official partnership, cable will have some legal document to be exchanged)</em><br><br><em>CC commits to taking leadership on learning <s>and badge</s> content and an appropriate recognition schema, and final decisions in this area are being made according to the CC governance structure.</em><br><br><em>P2PU commits to taking leadership on the learning platform and assessment, and final decisions in this area are being made based on P2PU values and using P2PU governance structures. (how is assessment different from recognition schema&#x2F;and or badges above?)</em><br><br><em>CC and Mozilla jointly own the rights to School of Open names and logos. Any potential revenue from the School of Open is shared between CC and P2PU.
