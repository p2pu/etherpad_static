<body><strong>Webcraft 101 Challenges</strong><br><br>high level goals:<br>- existing challenges are TOO easy, not technical enough<br>- want to build towards a portfolio<br>- webcraft == WEB development<br>- people should be producing things<br>- would be kind of nice if challenges built on each other (or at least had the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; option to do so)&nbsp;<br>- integrate peer collaboration as possible<br><br>observations&#x2F;suggestions:<br>- it&#x27;s not a school of programming, it&#x27;s a school of webcraft. there&#x27;s tons of<br>&nbsp; sites and free resources out there already that help people learn to program.<br>&nbsp; our challenges should focus on getting them to USE those skills, at various<br>&nbsp; levels of experience, in web-related activities. to give them a web-lens on<br>&nbsp; their skills.&nbsp;<br>- what&#x27;s missing? a) providing concrete ways to put those pieces together with<br>&nbsp; a learner&#x27;s interests simplifies the learning process while avoiding purely<br>&nbsp; procedural repetition. also getting feedback and learning with a community of<br>&nbsp; peers.<br>- unlock a forum of others who have completed the challenges - Really like this idea (JB) See Alex H&#x27;s comments in chat (and copied at the end of this pad)<br>&nbsp; - mentorship&#x2F;community&#x2F;peer-learning: can ask questions of others who have<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; already arrived here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - a bit like an alumni network, where you shared this experience and can help<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you find others of common interests, skills. (The time-based piece of this is important. If you can create bottom-up, organic cohorts that would be ideal.)<br>&nbsp; - comparison (cf. project euler) - how did others solve the problem?&nbsp;<br><br>components of a good challenge (awesome list from chloe)<br>- simple &quot;setup&quot; (easy to understand) -complex problem<br>- clear, tangible goals<br>- giving them a role<br>- need to know: reputation, personal interest, etc.&nbsp;<br>- embedded assessment&#x2F;feedback<br>- achievements are meaningful<br>- risk taking&#x2F;exploration<br>- scaffolding<br>- tool&#x2F;something to unlock?<br>- fun&#x2F;playful aspect?<br>- agency (choosing the content&#x2F;web service&#x2F;problem to apply the challenge to)&nbsp;<br><br>webcraft 101: categories of skills. focus on exposure and application.&nbsp;<br>- programming, control logic, data structures<br>- design (layout, css, assets)<br>- APIs (both a cateogry and great way to tie all the other categories<br>&nbsp; together...)<br>- basic server configuration, project deployment. (? maybe? is this 101? or<br>&nbsp; maybe early 201?)<br>- data processing, databases, storage<br>- participation in the open web ecosystem: posting blogs, sharing code,<br>&nbsp; participating in forums, mailing lists, submitting bugs, submitting patches.<br><br>additional cultural exposures and supporting skills<br>- command line - definitely worthwhile (JB)<br>- text editors (version control? I wonder how early git can be introduced. -AH)<br>- following technology developments - know what&#x27;s out there to use for tools +<br>&nbsp; get ideas from what others are developing (eg. readwriteweb, techcrunch,<br>&nbsp; etc.)<br>- attend&#x2F;organize a hackathon - attending is much easier than organizing... there should be badges for both. (JB)<br>- reading code (commenting code &#x2F; self-documenting -AH)<br><br><strong>=============== CHALLENGE IDEAS ==============</strong><br><br>strongly advise using jsfiddle.net in your challenges, I&#x27;ve done some lessons with people and it works really well for newbies. Gets them up and building really fast. (JB)<br>overall arc of 101 challenges (to incorporate categories above)<br>- pick an editor (and use it!) - how hard is this really? Maybe it&#x27;s more of a getting started task&#x2F;pre-requisite (JB)<br>- retrieve remote documents (API) (json&#x2F;xml formats...)<br>- parse them in a for loop of some kind (skill: programming)<br>- apply some kind of condition to them (skill: programming)<br>- save the data somewhere that it can be easily queried (skill: storage, maybe basic sysadmin)<br>- create a user-facing web page for the data (skills: css, UI&#x2F;UX)<br>&nbsp; - could be complex&#x2F;simple, depending... JS, python, ruby, html... get to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expose ideas of dynamic content, the fact that html is not dynamic content,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to get dynamic content from a script into a document that can be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displayed by the webserver.&nbsp;<br>- deploy the site (deployment, system admin&#x2F;interaction, command line tools, etc.)<br>- benefits: can be done multiple times in different languages, with different<br>&nbsp; search terms, etc. - Repeating in different languages is great, unlock a badge for each language? (JB)<br><br><strong>programming challenge</strong><br>- general approach: let user choose APIs (of interest to them) from which to<br>&nbsp; get data. they&#x27;ll use this info to apply basic&#x2F;core programming skills.&nbsp;<br>- leverage the tools out there (free resources&#x2F;books&#x2F;sites on intro programming)<br>- make it clear that the first ones might take some trial and error, that&#x27;s ok!<br>- language is up to them but would suggest&#x2F;recommend one of ruby, javascript,<br>&nbsp; or python<br>- sources with very broad and dynamic data, have both json&#x2F;yaml and xml<br>&nbsp; response formats:<br>&nbsp; - twitter API - receive latest public tweets with a specific hashtag.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - times newswire API: <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;developer&#x2e;nytimes&#x2e;com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;times&#x5f;newswire&#x5f;api">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nytimes.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;times_newswire_api</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - wikipedia API:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikipedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia&#x3a;Creating&#x5f;a&#x5f;bot&#x23;APIs&#x25;5Ffor&#x25;5Fbots">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Creating_a_bot#APIs%5Ffor%5Fbots</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (probably a little harder, feel like it&#x27;s not as clearly documented--<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should look into it more before suggesting it). - you can access the docs by hitting the api with a browser. Very detailed docs, but not the easiest to read&#x2F;navigate (JB) And a great way to alienate the WP community. Bad bots (WP or other) can be very bad :( (AH).&nbsp;<br>- choose a search term or criteria, think about what documents you want to<br>&nbsp; retrieve<br>&nbsp; - provide some speciifc guidance here for people who don&#x27;t have their own<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idea yet: ie, a search term related to a current event, a specific<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interest... We should provide an example implementation that is funny, easy to understand, and still covers all the key points (JB)<br>- read the API docs, register for an API key if necessary.&nbsp;<br>- start programming. with your editor of choice, open a new file in a directory<br>&nbsp; for your project. it can be anywhere on your machine... explain what a directory structure is? maybe we can assume they know this already. (JB)<br>- in your language of choice, retrieve and parse your documents:<br>&nbsp; - read about how to make an HTTP &quot;GET&quot; request in your language of choice<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (insert helpful&#x2F;descriptive text&#x2F;links about http, what is a get request,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how it works, etc. here... maybe link to john&#x27;s webmaking 101 stuff)) - GET &#x2F; POST &#x2F; PUT &#x2F; DELETE - I think this is a good place to include a video explaining that the web is client&#x2F;server and that web pages are documents. Browser requests include VERBS that tell the server what to do. (JB)<br>&nbsp; - determine the URL that you want to call. this will be determined by the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; docs for the API and the features of the API that you want to use.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; - make note of what format will you request the response in? why? - give a few example formats (XML, JSON, CSV) (JB)<br>&nbsp; - set up the HTTP call<br>&nbsp; - retrieve the data<br>&nbsp; - using a for-loop, iterate over the documents your API call retrieved and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pull out the data&#x2F;body, and any of the included metadata that interests you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - you will need to create one or more variables to store this extracted data! - Some langauges require variable declaration and typing... does yours? (JB)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - how many documents did your call retrieve?<br>&nbsp; - print out some information about the retrieved documents, and&#x2F;or the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documents themselves, to the command line. play around with formatting, and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consider different statistics you might want to present to the user. how many documents were retrieved? at what time of day?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sort your results by date &#x2F; title (JB)<br>&nbsp; - bonus? instead of hard coding the search term, let the user specify the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; search term as input once your script is running.&nbsp;<br>- what is the output?&nbsp; post the code to a public code repo? blog about it? - recommend github (JB)<br>- badges? logic, APIs, web plumbing (HTTP)? (Comments in Chat- AH)<br><br>storage challenge:<br>- instead of printing out, save it to a local data store<br>- mysql, nosql...<br>- will probably involve local installation (avoid server installation for now,<br>&nbsp; but still a bit of sysadmin&#x2F;configuration exposure) (learning to configure your machine to do some of these things ends up being more complex than learning to do them on a remote server in my experience - AH)<br>- what fields from the retrieved data do you want to save?<br>- there may be other fields you want to add too-- perhaps retrieval time, user<br>&nbsp; who did the search, search term, etc.&nbsp;<br>- demonstrate saving it and subseqently retrieving it, perhaps by doing a query<br>&nbsp; over multiple saved documents.&nbsp;<br>- output:&nbsp;<br>- badges? configuration, database-something-something<br><br>data challenge<br>- the learner can then compare&#x2F;have an understanding of what it means to use an<br>&nbsp; API versus download data, pros and cons of each<br>- can relate it back to the search term or theme from API challenge<br>- use their data storage experience (from data storage challenge, above) to<br>&nbsp; store the data, and realize they have to figure out how to store and retrieve<br>&nbsp; data from different sources with different fields.&nbsp;<br>- sources:<br>&nbsp; - infochimps: infochimps.com<br>&nbsp; - world bank data: data.worldbank.org<br><br><br>UI&#x2F;UX challenge<br>- design a very simple layout or use a template?<br>- need a SUPER simple web framework for ruby and python (not needed for JS)<br>Ruby - Sinatra<br>Python - Flask<br>UI&#x2F;UX - Twitter Bootstrap &#x2F; 960.gs<br><br>Code Re-use &#x2F; reading code challenge<br>- find someone *else&#x27;s* webcraft 101 programming challenge, and build your own<br>&nbsp; UI for it. (how do we bootstrap this when there are no examples yet? (JB)<br>- chance to read code<br>- appreciate importance of documentation (or lack thereof)<br>- person whose project you pick gets the benefit of having someone critique<br>&nbsp; their project.&nbsp;<br>(Really important to get at this&nbsp;<br><strong>======================================</strong><br><strong>other challenge ideas (still 101-level but aren&#x27;t necessarily part of the &quot;arc&quot;</strong><br><strong>described above)</strong><br><strong>=======================================</strong><br><br>UX: really like this one, could go be any site, not just sites from webcraft (JB)<br>- go through existing sites and critique them from a UX perspective. what is<br>&nbsp; the site&#x27;s goal? are you enabled in accomplishing that goal by the layout of<br>&nbsp; the content? are the action buttons clear? can you find what you need? can<br>&nbsp; you identify a clear path through the site? etc...<br>- write up a critique, using some web tool that lets you annotate screenshots, publish a blog post on it.&nbsp;<br>- find a site you like but that doesn&#x27;t do this well. mock up a wireframe,<br>&nbsp; using one of the many online wireframing tools, that tells a new story for<br>&nbsp; this site. document how the missing actionable items&#x2F;navigation&#x2F;paths through<br>&nbsp; the site are implemented by your design.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- do a mini user-study. show the layout to someone, ask them what they think<br>&nbsp; its purpose is, if they understand it, like it. accept their feedback<br>&nbsp; graciously :). - this is also a great task, I think we&#x27;d need an example and a couple videos (JB)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; So, I guess my fear in the above is this feels a lot like UX-light. Maybe that&#x27;s the formalist&#x2F;old-school in me talking, but I would worry that this encourages a very superficial idea of both UX and user studies. I would split these into separate challanges with a bit more of an expectation in the spec. E.g., an IA task, a UI design task, a user study, etc. -AH<br><br>Comments from Alex:<br><br><em>November 21, 2011</em><br>15:45Alex H.: Just to note, I like the idea of unlocking a forum too.<br>15:45Alex H.: That said, there is a balance to be struck between transparency and peer pedagogy.<br>15:46Alex H.: I survived my math courses by flipping to the back of the book and working backwards. Which (and I doubt I was alone) was better than working through the solutions in the &quot;teaching&quot; part of the book.<br>15:47Alex H.: You want people to figure stuff out on their own, but it&#x27;s also good to have a model.<br>15:47Philipp: Could be that the forum is read-only until you unlock the ability to post?<br>15:48Alex H.: To take a counter-example, I was pretty surprised at how the Zen-influenced Japanese arts--particularly tea ceremony and flower arranging, and sushi prep by extension--are based on modeled behavior.<br>15:48Alex H.: Philipp: yeah, that makes sense.<br>15:49Alex H.: (Judo is the exception to this, and a heavily western influenced mediation of the standard.)<br>15:49Alex H.: But for flower arranging, for example, your aim is to *exactly* duplicate a master model.<br>15:50Alex H.: That seems like (a) a really boring way to study and (b) lame.<br>15:50Alex H.: But it&#x27;s hard to argue with results, which they do produce.<br>15:50Philipp: Nothing says mastery like a fine flower arrangement.<br>15:50Alex H.: Now, mastering the flow of ink to write a perfect, expressive, artistic character is different than coding.<br>15:50Alex H.: You can&#x27;t copy-paste flower&#x2F;tea&#x2F;calligraphy.<br>15:51Alex H.: You can copy-paste math. Kids do it all the time and learn nothing.<br>15:51Alex H.: And writing code wrong is actually a really good way to learn.<br><br></body>
