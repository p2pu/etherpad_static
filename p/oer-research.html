<body>OER Research Hub and P2PU<br><br>Background<br><br>Hypotheses:<br>Improvement in student performance<br><br>Hypotheses:&nbsp;<br><br>Use of OER leads to improvement in student performance and satisfaction<br>The open aspect of OER creates different usage and adoption patterns than other online resources&nbsp;<br><br>Informal learners use a variety of indicators when selecting OER<br>Informal means of assessment are motivators to learning with OER<br><br>Vanessa and I chatted and would love your feedback. We also have some questions about what the fellowship funds might cover. These are the&nbsp; research questions we are interested in for P2PU and School of Open:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>How does mentorship occur through OER or other tools used in the course? How do feedback interactions occur?</li><li>How do people get over fear of learning open and practicing open?</li><li>How and in what way is open (open tools, resources, practices) useful to people?</li><li>How do people evaluate new open content, tools, and services?</li><li><em>(Specific to School of Open) How does recruitment of an open&nbsp; community of volunteers work? Is there something specific about the subject of &quot;open&quot;?</em></li><li>Measuring impact of SOO courses -- do educators understand open better after? &#x2F; Measuring critical reflection from educators on whether or not their students have learned about the value of open materials</li></ul><br>The first four seem to fall under your larger research question,&nbsp; &quot;How does OER&#x2F;openness change peoples attitudes and practices when it&nbsp; comes to sharing?&quot; So I feel like there would be a good fit for a&nbsp; fellowship. Regarding ideas of what we envision the actual $ being spent&nbsp; on:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Vanessa or I (or both of us) fly to UK at end of course so we can work together on a:<ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Report - series of recommendations on our findings (would include interviews with course facilitators, etc.)</strong></li><li>Dedicate some time to have course organizers implement findings into next iteration of courses</li></ul></li><li>Fly&nbsp; in a few course facilitators to work on research and improve the next&nbsp; iteration of courses based on research (don&#x27;t know if there is enough&nbsp; money for that or if this is something that fellowship covers)</li><li>Send Vanessa to a relevant conference or other event that is about OER research after we complete report remotely in our respective&nbsp; countries?</li><li>Provide guidelines via OER research hub - room for some other kind of relationship</li><li>Action research - stuff people can use.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>Fellowship logistics<br><ul class="bullet"><li>does not cover peoples time&#x2F;salary</li><li>per diem of 100 british pounds&#x2F;day--is this during the proposed trip? yes, up to 4 weeks for researcher&#x27;s subsistence</li><li>expenses associated with generation of the report is a separate line item, travel to conferences is a separate line item</li><li>Limit is $6,000 british pounds for travel and subsistence</li><li>Other funds (like for generation of report)--we should estimate as a line item in our grant proposal</li><li>Open fellowships - anyone interested in OER can apply - May 5</li></ul><br>Next steps<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Simone get back to us re &quot;provide guildeines via oer research hub&quot; other kind of relationship</li><li>Then Vanessa, Jane and Beck work together to draft research fellowship proposal</li><li>Deadline?
