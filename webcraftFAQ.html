As one of the world&#x27;s leading open source projects, Mozilla believes that teaching and learning open standards helps keep the web open and awesome.&nbsp; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;mozilla&#x2e;org&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;</a><br><br><strong>How can I get involved in the School of Webcraft?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br><u>Propose a course</u>, <u>take a course</u>, or contribute ideas by<u> joining our community.</u> The School of Webcraft&#x27;s <u>weekly community calls</u> are also open to all to attend.

Where do they meet?</strong><br>School of Webcraft classes are held entirely online, and run from six to ten weeks. Anyone, anywhere with access to the web is free to apply for a course. Some courses hold online meetings or presentations each week. Other courses run asynchronously, and rely entirely on email and forum communication instead of online meetings.<br><br><strong>How much does it cost to take a course?</strong><br>Nothing. School of Webcraft courses are 100% free.<br><br><strong>I&#x27;d like to take a School of Webcraft course. How do I do that?</strong><br>Visit our course registration page to apply for a class [<a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;drumbeat&#x2e;org&#x2F;webcraft&#x2F;sign&#x2d;up">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drumbeat.org&#x2F;webcraft&#x2F;sign-up</a>]. Course registration typically opens two or three weeks before the start of classes. Please note that because demand for coures is high, we can&#x27;t guarantee that all applicants will be accepted into a course.<br><br><strong>I&#x27;d like to teach a School of Webcraft course. How do I do that?</strong><br>You can propose a School of Webcraft course here, through our course proposal form:&nbsp;<br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;viewform&#x3f;formkey&#x3d;dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spreadsheets.google.com&#x2F;viewform?formkey=dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ</a><br>You can also have a look at P2PU&#x27;s &quot;Course Design Handbook&quot; for tips and guidlines on how to design a course. [<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;w&#x2F;page&#x2F;27905271&#x2F;Course&#x2d;Design&#x2d;Handbook">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.p2pu.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;page&#x2F;27905271&#x2F;Course-Design-Handbook</a>] Or have a look at the list of courses the School of Webcraft offered last term.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>I&#x27;d like to suggest a course idea, but not necessarily teach it myself. Can I do that?</strong><br>Sure! Suggest your course idea using P2PU&#x27;s <u>UserVoice forum</u>. [<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;uservoice&#x2e;com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;84091&#x2d;course&#x2d;suggestions">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.uservoice.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;84091-course-suggestions</a>] You can also vote on other people&#x27;s course suggestions there.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Do I need to be an expert to lead a course?</strong><br>You don&#x27;t need to be a world-leading expert on your topic. While it certainly helps to have some background knowledge about the course you organise, the most important thing is to be committed to sharing your learning experience with other passionate people.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>How much of a time commitment is typically involved in running a course?</strong><br>Leading a School of Webcraft course typically takes up to about three hours a week, over six to ten weeks. A lot of the day-to-day time commitment stems from answering emails&nbsp; from participants and moderating discussions.<br><br>Course organisers should also plan on setting aside some time ahead of the course start to design their course, structure the schedule, gather resources, and get some feedback from the community.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What kinds of courses is the School of Webcraft looking for? What&#x27;s in scope, and what isn&#x27;t?</strong><br>The School of Webcraft is dedicated to teaching and promoting web development based on open standards. For example, courses on HTML5 are in scope. Courses on Flash are not. Our courses are built around tools that are accessible to any learner free of cost, and that allow participants to openly share their work. Participants are expected to openly license their code so that they can review, revise and adapt each others work.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What courses has the School of Webcraft taught so far?</strong><br>Here&#x27;s a list of courses we offered in the pilot round that began in September 2010.<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;drumbeat&#x2e;org&#x2F;cont">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drumbeat.org&#x2F;cont</a><br>If&nbsp; you threw a dart at a wall filled with the top websites from around the&nbsp; world, chances are excellent you&#x27;d hit one using PHP.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a quote from a favorite XtraNormal video of mine. And, although&nbsp; I think many would find large chunks of the video to be objectionable,&nbsp; the statement above rings largely true. PHP tends to get picked on from&nbsp; time to time (Ruby on Rails, I&#x27;m looking at you), but for all the&nbsp; negative press, PHP has proven itself time and time again for the&nbsp; greater part of the last decade. PHP developers are widely sought after,&nbsp; and some knowledge of PHP is nowdays an essential tool for any aspiring&nbsp; web developer.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This course is about programming in PHP. It&#x27;s about exploring PHP&#x27;s&nbsp; strengths and its flaws. It&#x27;s about why PHP has remained remarkably&nbsp; resilient, while many web application frameworks have come and gone in&nbsp; the time it&#x27;s taken PHP to become and remain a major web scripting&nbsp; language. It&#x27;s about learning to leverage the tool that is the PHP&nbsp; language, so that you build the website you&#x27;ve been dreaming about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew Buscemi<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Sign-up is closed.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Introduction to Ruby and Rails<br>Developing high quality web applications can be fun (... when using Ruby and Rails!) #webcraft #p2puShow more details<br><em>Ruby is a fascinating object-oriented language suited for many purposes.&nbsp; Rails is a popular web framework for Ruby.</em><br>This course will introduce the Ruby&nbsp; programming language, focusing on those features and concepts that will&nbsp; be important when developing web-based, database-backed Rails&nbsp; applications.<br>Course participants will learn with freely available web resources&nbsp; and by completing small assignments.&nbsp; Participants will also create a&nbsp; simple web application in small groups.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy Lindeman<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Sign-up is closed.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>jQuery~For the Love of Dollar<br>Imtermediate Level Course Covering jQuery API, Open Source Tools and jQuery Community ResourcesShow more detailsent&#x2F;webcraft-pilot-courses<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>I&#x27;d like to teach or learn in a language other than English.
