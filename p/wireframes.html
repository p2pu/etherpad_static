<body><strong>THIS IS A DRAFT</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>In the last few weeks, we held two technology design meetings (in Toronto, and San Francisco) to come up with a high-level roadmap for the new site. We will post an update on overall timeline on the blog next week, but wanted to get feedback on the basic design, and the bigger ideas behind it, from a few core members of the community, to make sure we are on track, and not forgetting any major features you will need.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>Big Picture -&gt; From Courses to Peer Learning<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>The long-term goal is to support true peer learning, study groups organized by anyone, on any topic. We are taking the first steps in that direction with the prototype, but we have a long way to go ...&nbsp;</li><li>We are planning to start hosting prototype courses in late April, and complete migration to the new site by July. The roadmap is here: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;github&#x2e;com&#x2F;p2pu&#x2F;lernanta&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lernanta&#x25;27s&#x2d;Roadmap">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;p2pu&#x2F;lernanta&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lernanta%27s-Roadmap</a></li><li>The current site only supports one type of peer learning - in a course that&nbsp; had a clear separation between the role of the organizer and the&nbsp; participants. The new site will support more flexible models. It will still be possible to run a fairly traditional &quot;course&quot;, in fact users of the current site could run their &quot;courses&quot; in virtually the exact same way on the new site, but the new site will also allow (and increasingly encourage) more self-organized groups of learners to work together.&nbsp;</li><li>There are some changes to terminology, which are intended to clarify how things work, break down hierarchies, and encourage peer learning, but don&#x27;t get hung up on the names for now.</li></ul><br>Tasks, Study Groups, and Schools<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>The main concepts that drive the new site are &quot;tasks&quot;, &quot;study groups&quot;, and &quot;schools&quot;.</li><li>Tasks are the basic building block of what users can work on (together or alone) at P2PU. Tasks can take many forms:<ul class="bullet"><li>A writing assignment that contains a list of readings, and a question to answer in a blog post. Participants post links to their blog posts as replies to the question.&nbsp;</li><li>A discussion topic, in which one person kicks off with a question, and the group posts answers. Discussions are threaded, so you can reply to a specific reply.&nbsp;</li><li>A collaborative project, in which users together edit one document to come up with a solution to a problem.</li></ul></li><li>Study groups are communities of people who commit to working through a set of tasks together. Users can &quot;join&quot; a study group to work together, or they can &quot;follow&quot; to keep tabs on what is going on without getting actively involved ... at least for now. Study groups can take many forms:<ul class="bullet"><li>They can decide to work on a long list of tasks, or very few;</li><li>Study groups can be small, with just a few people, or very large with hundreds of users;</li><li>They can be completely peer organized, or instructor led like a traditional course.</li></ul></li><li>Schools are collections of study groups, tasks, and users. We are not proposing any major changes to the way we had conceptualized schools in the past, but we will provide a much more user-friendly and engaging home for schools.<ul class="bullet"><li>A home page that contains the School logo and a primary color (more options for customization in the future).&nbsp;</li><li>A map of all the people who are part of the school community.</li><li>A list of study groups and tasks. Study groups related to schools will also contain the school logo and color.&nbsp;</li><li>If schools have assessments that lead to badges, we will show them on the schools home page.</li></ul></li></ul><br>Two Specific Questions&nbsp;<br><br>There are two issues that would be great to get more detailed feedback on.<br>Sign-up &#x2F; Join a study group: The current sign-up process is an inherently negative experience, and further stresses the hierarchical difference between the organizer and participants. We would like to make it a more positive activity, that builds social ties between peer learners, and intend to standardize the sign-up task across all study groups. All users will be asked to share why they want to join a group, and what they intend to get out of it, which is publicly visible to all other users in the group.&nbsp;<br><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>How to give feedback -- Ideally, on the lighthouse task tracker directly.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Study Group Home Page -- <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2d;lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;46&#x2d;study&#x2d;group&#x2d;home&#x2d;page&#x23;ticket&#x2d;46&#x2d;2">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002-lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;46-study-group-home-page#ticket-46-2</a></li><li>Schools Home Page -- <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2d;lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;49&#x2d;schools&#x2d;home&#x2d;page">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002-lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;49-schools-home-page</a></li><li>Task Page -- <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2d;lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;47&#x2d;task&#x2d;page">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002-lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;47-task-page</a></li><li>Sign-up Page -- <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2d;lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;48&#x2d;joinsign&#x2d;up&#x2d;page&#x23;ticket&#x2d;48&#x2d;2">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002-lernanta&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;48-joinsign-up-page#ticket-48-2</a></li></ul></li></ul><br>Sign-up process<br>Completion of tasks and study groups<br><br><br>Wireframes:<br><br><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu&#x2e;lighthouseapp&#x2e;com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;41&#x2d;prepare&#x2d;wireframes&#x23;ticket&#x2d;41&#x2d;5">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pu.lighthouseapp.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;71002&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;41-prepare-wireframes#ticket-41-5</a><br><br><br><br><strong>Study Group Page</strong><br><br>Notes:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>The study group page only has a minimum of predefined fields for certain types of information (e.g. intended start date).
