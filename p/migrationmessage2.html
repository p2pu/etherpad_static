<body><strong>Questions:</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li><em>Do we break out section III and announce those courses in the coming weeks instead?</em></li><li><em>Do we need quotes, more fluffy text about P2PU in this to make it work as a press release(press releases are dinosaurs) that others will find useful to adapt?</em></li></ul><br><br><strong>Title: P2PU is moving<s>&nbsp; &#x2F; P2PU &amp; School of Webcraft are moving&nbsp;</s></strong><br><br>Yes, the long-awaited migration from the old P2PU site to our new home is almost upon us, and we&#8217;re really excited. Can you tell?<br><br>(insert excited image, probably of john britton grinning)<br><br><strong>I) New site - what&#x27;s different?</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Our new site is fresh, intuitively designed, and easier to use.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>It&#8217;s built for peer learning.</strong> In addition to courses, learners are welcome to create informal study groups and open collaborative projects. <s>as well, kind of like a book club, where learners discuss and share for as long as they want to - a week, a month, a semester - it&#x27;s up to you.</s> To make peer learning easier, we are building an engagement ladder, that helps casual visitors to the site become rockstar group facilitators.</li><li><strong>It&#x27;s social and personal. </strong>Now you can follow people on the site, regardless of whether you&#x27;re in the same course or group or not. You can also follow courses - even if you&#x27;re not an active participant<s> if you don&#x27;t want to get involved more actively,</s> but would like to keep an eye on what&#x27;s going on. And when you join a course or study group, you set your own learning goals.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><s>It&#x27;s personal.</s></strong><s> It&#x27;s more geared to how individual people learn within a group - when you sign up you can define your learning goals to suit your purpose.&nbsp;</s></li><li><strong>It&#x27;s open.</strong> It&#x27;s built by an open source community that anyone can join. Our roadmap and code are publicly available, and we discuss progress and challenges in weekly tech meetings. It&#x27;s also open in the sense that all peer-produced content is still publicly reusable under the Creative Commons BY-SA license (link to <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons&#x2e;org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;by&#x2d;sa&#x2F;3&#x2e;0&#x2F;&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;by-sa&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;)</a>.</li></ul><br>Even though there is a lot of change, the site and P2PU will never be <em>fini</em> or &quot;done.&quot; Based on your feedback, and what we learn about learning, we will constantly update and improve what we&#x27;re doing, so we can continue to spread peer learning to as many people as we can reach ....&nbsp;<br>(Read more after the jump)<br><br><s>We&#8217;re hoping that this new site will be the base from which the P2PU community can continue to leverage the internet and educational materials openly available online and enable high-quality, low-cost education opportunities for as many people has we can reach.</s><br><br><br><strong>II) Get started</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Create an account, or log-in with your existing account (your old P2PU username and password still work).&nbsp;</li><li>Check out these great courses:</li><li>Or create a whole new ...</li><li>Need more info, or want to learn more about how the site works, watch screencasts, and read through the handbook? Join the helpdesk ...&nbsp;</li></ul><br><br><strong>III) Featured courses and study groups</strong><br><br>P2PU is extremely proud to be working with some fantastic partners on some really exciting courses. Have a look at these:&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Saylor</li><li>Webcraft</li><li><em>What else?</em></li></ul><br>Not all P2PU courses or groups are organised by partners though. Some of them are organised by committed and enthusiastic peer learners. Take a look at these courses <em>(which ones would be best here?)</em><br><br><br>P2PU - learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything.&nbsp;<br><br>==LONGER SECTION TO BE ADDED TO MAILER&#x2F; BLOG POST &#x2F; HELP DESK==<br><br><strong>How to get started</strong><br><br>If you&#8217;re new to P2PU, the best way to get started is to create an account. If you&#8217;ve already registered, even on the old site, then you should have an account already set up. Once you have an account, you can use the My P2PU link in the top right corner of the page to manage your profile and view any messages you may have. We recommend that you add a photo and plenty of detail to your profile, so that people can see who you are and what you&#8217;re interested in learning.<br><br><strong>What happened to the Front Page?</strong><br><br>Like Facebook or Twitter and many other sites, the new P2PU site doesn&#8217;t have a front page, like the old one did. Instead, every time you log&nbsp; on,&nbsp; you will find yourself on your dashboard. From here you can track&nbsp; the&nbsp; activity in groups that you are a part of, or you can use the&nbsp; Learn,&nbsp; People, Schools and Blog links across the top of the page to&nbsp; find&nbsp; groups, view people&#8217;s profiles and follow them, explore the&nbsp; Schools that&nbsp; are part of P2PU or visit our blog.<br><br><strong>Join the Help Desk</strong><br><br>Think of the help desk as a 24 hour, 365 day a year orientation. This is the place where all the &#8220;how to&#8221; info about the new site is kept, and shared, and where you can ask any questions you may have. Have a look in the Tasks section of the helpdesk for some great screencasts and discussions on the best ways to start learning.<br><br><strong>Find a course or study group</strong><br><br>Now that you&#8217;ve got your account all up and running, it&#8217;s time to learn! Your can browse all the current courses and study groups that are under development, newly open, and already running by clicking on the&nbsp; &#8220;Learn&#8221;&nbsp; link at the top of your dashboard. This will show you all the courses and groups, and their status.<br><br><strong>Create your own course or study group</strong><br><br>If you&#8217;d like to create your own course or group, have a look at this great screencast how-to.<br><br><strong>Find materials from old courses that ran on the previous site</strong><br><br>If you were a participant in, or organiser of a course on the previous site, and you can&#8217;t find it on the new one, never fear! You can import the material directly using this great tool:&nbsp; <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;new&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;import&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.p2pu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;groups&#x2F;import&#x2F;</a><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><br></body>
