<body>Notes regarding research at &#x2F; involving P2PU. (Scroll back in the timeline for earlier notes)<br><br><br><strong>Reactions &#x2F; Questions &#x2F; Comments:</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>In the past, we got caught up over data privacy issues - what about privacy?<ul class="bullet"><li>can we do things in a more lightweight way? (Jessy quoting bekka) ha!</li><li>One suggestion is that we do a database dump, and we make it available to them (Bekka)</li><li>The university has to stick to it&#x27;s own ethics&#x2F;data management restrictions, which are very strict</li><li>2 options:&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>We anonymise the data before we give it to them</li><li>They could clean it for us, develop scripts for us to do this in general</li><li>Things to consider:<ul class="bullet"><li>email addresses</li><li>passwords</li><li>private messages within the system</li><li>visit tracking (what is this?)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>it would be great if part of the partnership could be cleaning and releasing the data openly</li></ul></li><li>would be great to get P2PU&#x27;s name on some academic papers :)<ul class="bullet"><li>what would qualify P2PU as a co-author? if individuals from P2PU participate they would be co-authors</li><li>we could try to open the process for participation by P2PU users</li></ul></li><li>Jessy -&gt; We might want to have a 2 step approach -1. anonymise, and 2. check to make sure it&#x27;s been done appropriately.&nbsp;</li><li>we should have a p2pu course - er - project - challenge, whatever, on studying the data. open to all!</li><li>Participation in the research:&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Can we ask people to join the community call as a condition of research?<ul class="bullet"><li>maybe not as a *condition*, but seems nice if&#x2F;that they would, and don&#x27;t see why they would object</li><li>And with any luck, they might even end up creating challenges&#x2F;courses or using the site for teaching in the future. Sucked in by the community!</li></ul></li><li>And even go so far as to suggest that P2PU users&#x2F;members become part of the research as co-authors<ul class="bullet"><li>IMHO i do think p2pu getting some credit at an appaopriate level is valuable to us for future fundraising, reputation, collaborations, etc.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>could be anything from the credit for the data to co-authorship if we actually do co-author</li><li>one question is how to facilitate collaboration at the authorship level. just organically?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>publication and access<ul class="bullet"><li>we should think about how to license our data more explicitly?</li><li>(jessy): propose we:&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>indicate strong preference for OA publication</li><li>require self-archiving&#x2F;public accessible (?)</li></ul></li><li>Ali -&gt; if a group of researchers are required to keep their research publications closed, can they not work around it by publishing draft versions?<ul class="bullet"><li>yes drafts can often be self-archived, but sometimes there is quite a big difference between the draft and final version</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br>Questions:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Relationship data &#x2F; content license</li><li>Get input from OKFN</li></ul><br></body>
