Introduce self and course you ran. If you had to sum up one main takeaway from your course this round, what would it be?<ul class="bullet"><li>Billy - OPen science - broad spectrum of participation</li><li>Simeon - Why OPen? - how wide it was but how willing people are to explore broad topics. too little time to cover anything in depth. in general it was too broad a topic, needed to break it down into smaller segments for it to really come together.</li><li>Laura - Copyright 4 Educators (US) - second time running it (offered 3 x prior). general arc - limited to 40, was pretty ruthless about cutting and making people leave if they werent doing assignments. didn&#x27;t want people to pair off with people who weren&#x27;t there. pick one person to be a buddy (partners) worked pretty well. useful in lessening frustration of participants but a lot more work on facilitators end. did have much higher participation through first 2&#x2F;3 of the course. started out with 40 and dropped to 25 or so, maintained this through the first third, and most of that through second third, and significant drop off in last third. last third subject matter shifts a bit, away from pure copyright to CC&#x2F;paracopyright or other matters. or just accelerating attrition. Weekly chats - same 2 people got together - useful to them - but not useful to facilitator</li></ul></li><li>What worked?<ul class="bullet"><li>Simeon<ul class="bullet"><li>Twitter chat and Google hangout - one a week. these were awesome bc it helped to bring on board people who didnt had time to read through the materials. so different people joined inthese actvitites. melting point for weeks worth of work. Frequency of twitter chats helped people keep up to date on course, connect with other people and see how dif views melted together</li><li>Created a Twitter account with hashtag for the course</li><li>distributed facilitation - could easily catch up by watching recorded twitter chats, google hangouts, plus constant communicationw with quick updates<ul class="bullet"><li>one faciltiators had to be the organizer</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Billy<ul class="bullet"><li>Google hangouts on air - 3 panels across 3 weeks. Billy, someone helping facilitate speakers,a nd broadcast. 20-25 people watching the live broadcast with 10 people in hangout. Recording</li><li>Using etherpad during live hangouts was useful - some folks wished we had more robust version of etherpad that had chat in window</li><li>Not requiring much, but having dif options for people to participate</li><li>specifically invited speakers that were already active using social media s- they helped with outreach&#x2F;marketing. speakers were also pretty high profile<ul class="bullet"><li>pretty templated email that i sent to ask people to join as a guest speaker. had more people respond than i had spots for. having invitation ready, id panel as more of a conversation, exploratory conversation, and less of a top-down approach. conversation around topic but without specific goals. everyone presented in a dif way, eg. ppt. personal stories. bring a question from people in the broadcast</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Laura<ul class="bullet"><li>Partners&#x2F;buddies worked</li><li>Google hangouts worked w&#x2F;high maintenance students - open hours and Google hangout</li><li>Google group open to everyone to post to</li><li>Set everything up for them</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Question for those who ran a course before. What changed between Round 1 and 2?<ul class="bullet"><li>Laura<ul class="bullet"><li>Technical problems lessened from last time - set everything up for them this time</li><li>fall off from participation was less</li><li>individual buddies versus small groups - personal responsbility to another defined individual</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What could still be improved? and&#x2F;or challenges&#x2F;issues<ul class="bullet"><li>Laura<ul class="bullet"><li>how scalable is that for a volunteer facilitator to do all that additional work to prevent drop off. takes a lot of effort to keep people on task</li><li>implementing more of a sign-up procedure at the beginning would be helpful - eg. i understand that i will be doing... contract&#x2F;agreement btw participants or just commitment to the class</li><li>a bunch of people i work w&#x2F; turned out to be IT people, so they are already a leg up but it was still challenging for a lot of them. really a barrier for people</li><li>would be great to have everything embedded into p2pu</li><li>disqus didn&#x27;t work for me -&nbsp;</li><li>so using google docs</li></ul></li><li>Simeon<ul class="bullet"><li>Getting people to join and retaining them. 5(?) in total that were active.&nbsp;</li><li>Someone in Nairobi couldnt participate bc technology. So find tech tools that lower the barrier to participation. We used too many dif tools, and some of them are intimidating. Find tools that dont have signups or are very intuitive to use</li><li>Disqus is just not useful</li></ul></li><li>Billy<ul class="bullet"><li>Using disqus as a way for participants to post a link to the blog<ul class="bullet"><li>manual notification about each thing</li></ul></li><li>anything that you have to sign up for is one more barrier</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Distributed Technology - so what is needed at core to run a course?<ul class="bullet"><li>Google group&#x2F;listserve</li><li>badge system</li><li>Google hangout</li><li>messaging board in every single course, like Wikipedia&#x27;s Talk page but simpler (that doesnt require a login, new account), a discussion tool (something where participants can talk)<ul class="bullet"><li>disqus didn&#x27;t work for this</li><li>google group - wanted it to be for more develoipment of course and discussion of the course. might have worked for a discussion board. and its not as easy to use and intuitive to use for newcomers - listservs are hard for discussion</li></ul></li><li>Social media, eg. Twitter updates - best used for broadcast</li><li>Wiki&#x2F; etherpad&#x2F;google docs</li><li>Suggestions:<ul class="bullet"><li>maybe if all facilitators got together before running the course to brainstorm the few tools</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>2014 facilitation schedule: 3 rounds - what dates work best for everyone?<ul class="bullet"><li>1. February or March 2014?<ul class="bullet"><li>Pete:&nbsp; Likely that WIKISOO will be offered in approximately this time slot.&nbsp; May not have flexibility to time it precisely, but will try!</li><li>Jessica - Feb would have to be late. Teachers come back from holiday late jan&#x2F;early feb. early march</li><li>Billy - late Jan or Feb (want to get through 2nd time before commiting to 3rd time)</li><li>Laura - maybe - want to try to get somebody else to do it with you - start thread w&#x2F;Lila</li><li>Simeon - March. why open overlaps with knowledge prog with soo kenya so would be interested. if there is a team available next time then happy to run it again. also want to create a standalone course.<ul class="bullet"><li>each week si a specific focus&#x2F;theme</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>2. June or July 2014? (off the School year is good for these folks)<ul class="bullet"><li>Christina</li><li>Jeanette</li><li>Jessica</li><li>Billy - possibly</li><li>Simeon - depends on the course - facilitation of first round (more than happyt o refine each time, and do 3x just to get perfect balance of content)</li></ul></li><li>3. September or October 2014?<ul class="bullet"><li>Jessica</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Nonfacilitated versions<ul class="bullet"><li>Pete&nbsp; - looking to develop one for WikiSOO - w&#x2F;weekly lab sessions ppl can&nbsp; log into. So could develop other people to teach the course, eg&nbsp; Jeanette!</li><li>Simeon - standalone version of Why Open?</li><li>Billy - tasks have been designed so people can do them on their own, but theres so much in the course that people cant get through it. so would have to be split int 3 standalone courses. explore later ..</li></ul></li><li>Quick update on platform requests&#x2F;features: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;trello&#x2e;com&#x2F;board&#x2F;feedback&#x2d;and&#x2d;suggestions&#x2F;519f1f8ec9622886280016ff">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trello.com&#x2F;board&#x2F;feedback-and-suggestions&#x2F;519f1f8ec9622886280016ff</a><ul class="bullet"><li>Additional course ux feedback and suggestions?<ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Disqus doesnt work</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Recruiting new volunteers<ul class="bullet"><li>If you will not be running your course again, who should we reach out to run it?</li><li>Who should we reach out to generally to run a new SOO course?<ul class="bullet"><li>Michelle Sidler - facilitate open science or open humanities</li><li>Leila and Cliff Ombiru - get contacts from Simeon</li><li>Laura - one student she&#x27;ll with him</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Badges - how did they work for you? how did they work for your participants?<ul class="bullet"><li>Laura - about half of the people went through process of badges. people who care about them care about them. others not as interested. willing to use them.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li><strong>process of awarding the badge - 3 part form seems kind of open ended, but for our part we ended up just posting link back to commentary that i put in group. so didnt fit into categories outlined in form</strong></li><li><strong>one participant couldnt fix his typo - editing after the fact</strong></li></ul></li><li>Billy - only a few people actually went through process of badges. they seemed much more interested in material&#x2F;discussion than having a badge to take away. badges themselves didnt certify anything. more of an experience badge that we offered<ul class="bullet"><li>think they can be useful as a token of a participatn having an experience - have a bunch of other digital objects tied into it.</li><li>maybe next tiem - make it more simple to relate the badge to the tasks that they do. see potential in badges, so it was interesting to see there was little interest in them. explore increasing value of them.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>process -- no way to edit it once youve submitted feedback. so inflexible in this way.</strong><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>separate platform was complicated</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Simeon - nobody applied for why open badges. didn&#x27;t quite sense motivationa nd dint look into it myself</li></ul></li><li>Data I need to get from you (can do via email but heads up) for OER Research Hub fellowship by Oct 20<ul class="bullet"><li>1.&nbsp; # of participants who completed assignments at each level of&nbsp; facilitated courses, and also # of total completed assignments for course overall</li><li>2. # of participants who completed the facilitated courses</li><li>3. # of blog posts per course, if any</li><li>4.

Introduce self and course you ran. If you had to sum up one main takeaway from your course this round, what would it be?<ul class="bullet"><li>Jane - takeaway - small groups didnt work for CC4K12 this round</li><li>Jessica Smith - work with Delia Browne. Second cycle of Copyright 4 Ed (AUS) as part of SOO. Went great - doing it through Nat&#x27;l Copyright Unit in AU. Sent blitz out to people - other teachers picked it up and threw it on listserve. Limited to 60 students. Waitlist of 20. People who dropped out were non AU - and then only 3 ppl dropped out throughout the course.</li><li>Christina Hendricks - heard of P2PU via Twitter, there&#x27;s a School of Open! learned all issues around openness in last 2 mos. Took online course called ETMooc, connectivist course. Saw this course Why Open? that was listed, and pitched into work on it and found others interested too. Takeaway: Things tended to fall apart when we went into small groups. Partly that happened bc then they were doing work outside of the bigger group. Some of them werent doing anything, some were but we didnt know. Small groups were good for those who did get into it. Like them, but dont know how to do them better so everything doesn&#x27;t just die. People don&#x27;t really come back. Lots of attriition. 5&#x2F;60 still active. 20 who ever did anything.</li><li>Jeanette - worked with Christina on Why Open? and came to it through WikiSOO with Pete. Did know about P2PU before that via another course. Agree with Christina re small groups - work in person, but seem to be a challenge working over the Internet online. really be interested in thinking about how to get people to finish the course.&nbsp;</li><li>Pete - Writing Wikipedia Articles - 3rd time running it. The second round was our most effective. The main reason for that is that Sara and I who were running the class took for granted the 3rd time and didnt put as much energy into it the 3rd time. Progressed each time in terms of how we present the class -- not spread out across multiple platforms, cleaner presentation, but the downside is that you still have to communicate very well up front no matter how good your platform is. Reflected in how much our students ended up doing. Really did have some students do excellent work. More people sign up in 3 than 2. We had more consistent attendance from some people, but the students were a little more reluctant.</li></ul></li><li>What worked?<ul class="bullet"><li>Jessica - small groups of 4 worked for us<ul class="bullet"><li>Being associated with the NCU of AU - its our job, to keep in touch and engage with librarians and teachers throughout AU. Having that network is invaluable.</li><li>Capping at 60 - so people more interested got into the course.&nbsp;</li><li>Waitlist from first course to join - they were waiting for months.</li><li>Have it part of daily workload.</li><li>Got great feedback from participants too.</li><li>Right now AU is doing a huge review of copyright so schools have been slammed with copyright propaganda right now, so probably helped bc it was at the forefront</li><li>10 people who were required to take the course by their boss.<ul class="bullet"><li>Principal made their librarian. Most were technical colleges - dif roles but basically in charge of copyright stuff. Dean would require it.&nbsp;</li><li>Christina - copyright has just been overhauled in Canada too. would be big in canada.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Teachers can get professional dev credit for taking the course. A lot of them pay for seminars, but they can take this at home for free.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Pete&#x27;s Question: qualifying for this? Jess: really painful actually. IN US you have to do pd too, but here there are dif categories. one category is one that everyone struggles with and our coruse doesnt qualify for that yet. eg. if you took a course at uni, you could qualify for a credit at teaching assoc - we dont qualiy for that yet. but does qualify bottom level of PD. lower level - easiest hours to get. hours are recorded by whatever teaching association they&#x27;re associated with. so we&#x27;ll start with new south wales (75% of teachers) - intense process.</li></ul></li><li>Christina&#x27;s Question regarding small groups - so how did you get them to work continuously?<ul class="bullet"><li>Jess: 2 week intro period. Complete initial questionnaire - 10-11 questions. What sector do you teach in - what level, etc. Some geographical&#x2F;sector info. That&#x27;s how we formed groups. Timezone, commonalities. 2nd week, all we had them do was meet their group and decide on collaboration tool. Worked better with our schedule. But think that the 2 week intro period was really imp - 2 small tasks in first 2 weeks. Every once in a while people wont do enough work. But I tell them to tell me if they have problem with their group, and they do email me. We think our target audience is similar - but this time, they all cc-ed Jessica on their emails. So got every single email! First cycle no one did it, this time half the groups did it. Don&#x27;t know why it works... but it does. Every once in a while we had an early dropout, then I ask the group if they want someone new added to their group. All independent school teachers as well.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Christina<ul class="bullet"><li>having group cohesion got me more engaged in course i was doing - otherwise i would have dropped out. how to foster that ?</li><li>really liked the Twitter chats b&#x2F;c they brought in other people who weren&#x27;t part of the course, so could open it up to people beyond the course. +1 by jeanette</li><li>great resources on our course - found really interesting things to read and talk about</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Question for those who ran a course before. What changed between Round 1 and 2?<ul class="bullet"><li>Jessica - this time it was so much worse - technical issues. Completely dif questions from first cycle. Delia was gone for most of it. First cycle was stellar. People would call all the time (NCU). Too much participant interaction.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>this time it was due to clueless participants, eg. gmail accounts. also google docs - last cycle very few issues. but this time, had 3 or 4 ppl that deleted other groups assignments. very little had to do with p2pu.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>we are still having issues with some versions of explorer not working with the platform. most schools use explorer. so ppl were relying on emails over platform.</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>if they can just dl firefox&#x2F;chrome but this is blocked at a lot of schools so only option is explorer.</li><li>couldn&#x27;t get to readings either, so just put the readings in the folder. would just end up sending it as an attachment</li></ul></li><li><strong>archiving courses is still an issue</strong></li><li><strong>Delia - disqus wasnt working properly - follow up on that with dirk</strong><ul class="bullet"><li>disqus notifications werent working</li></ul></li><li>This time we sent out a weekly email every Monday - basically exactly what is on the course ux, but just send it out in an email making it really clear explaining exactlyw here to go, etc. People responded well to this.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What could still be improved? and&#x2F;or challenges&#x2F;issues<ul class="bullet"><li>Jessica - had a lot of technical issues. Handholding - lots of it! No gmail accounts, etc. As a facilitator - this is painful if this isnt your main gig.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>we really lay it out for them. we&#x27;d have a lot of ppl drop out if we dont. largely due to our target audience - older teachers and librarians. they are already nervous about an online course. these arent people who are jumping online trying to learn something new at night. these are people learning for PD bc they have a gap in their knowledge for their job.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Pete<ul class="bullet"><li>during&nbsp; course sessions, normally do lecture and sara monitors chat window -&nbsp; but otherwise they&#x27;ll answer each others questions. found self torn&nbsp; this&nbsp; time between enjoying and appreciating when stuff happened that&nbsp; was not directly related to class, but also not wanting to get&nbsp; distracted by it itself. Sort of have a gut sense of how I would want&nbsp; that flow in a traditional environment, but in a dif environment, we&nbsp; don&#x27;t have those norms yet. What is acceptable classroom behavior?</li><li>dont&#x27; know how to honor group cohesion past beyond end date of the class. missed the subtle opportunities regarding this.&nbsp;</li><li>also struggled with retention with all 3 rounds of our course. seems to me that people basiclaly really want us to break things down and tell them what to do much more incrementally than i&#x27;m inclined to. it would take a lot more prep work. reluctance on my part is work but also a less authentic wikipedia experience. but i think our students would respond a lot better if i created a list of 20 specific wikipedia articles with specific suggestions, eg. fix the grammar in this sentence of this article. hold their hand through first few edits. bigger logical leap for some people than i want to believe.&nbsp;</li><li>maybe a dif state of mind for someone who is a very creative person in general when they step into a class. they may just go into a mode where they expect things to be laid out in a clear fashion.&nbsp;</li><li>is it the kind of people we&#x27;re attracting or the expectations people are bringing to a class?</li><li>feedback for Pete re WikiSOO from Jeanette?

But these were adults so there was a bit of a disconnect between what we expected and what they might have expected. Most of us here are used to interacting in technology, but some people really w anted someone to hold their hand through the process. How do we get them to rethink that in an online environment.</li><li>in the blog - that was one comment that came up - they want more direction.&nbsp;</li><li>maybe have a participant expectation before we actually get into what the course is actually about. entering into the classroom space - people might fall back onto default position. but if we had a session talking through the dif pedagogy that we&#x27;re going to do that might help shift expectation. +11</li><li><strong>etherpad stopped working at some point - that was major tech issues</strong></li><li><strong>a few times had trouble with google hangout, had to go to twitter chat, bc we had people from all over. connectivity wasnt good.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul></li><li>Christina<ul class="bullet"><li>we didn&#x27;t have any expert people giving presentations. we had readings, but everything that was an activity - was to be done with each other, come up with their own ideas regarding blog posts. so less direction provided in our course. what are you most interested in in what you&#x27;ve read? this may not have fit most peoples learning styles.&nbsp;</li><li>twitter chats - problem was that only like 2 people were participating in these - and more by ppl not really registered.&nbsp;</li><li>not that much engagement past the first week or two. guess this is common with online courses. but doesnt always happen. so some ideas i have:&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>is it too much to ask people to create a blog&#x2F;write posts for such a short course? maybe should have just used built in discussion board</li><li>if other people aren&#x27;t reading those, then there&#x27;s no common area for discussion really except twitter chat and google hangout</li><li>but even when we were using discussion board, only one person did</li><li>what exactly wasnt working? little bit puzzled. only got 4 responses on end of course survey</li></ul></li><li>ours was more vague - why open? so we felt it would useful to have discussion, but then it requires that people feel comfortable learning from each other. maybe things to learn - then discussion after that. so inbetween our course and jessica&#x27;s approach.</li></ul></li><li><br></li></ul></li><li>2014 facilitation schedule: 3 rounds - what dates work best for everyone?<ul class="bullet"><li>1.

Maybe can still have this field, but not require it.&nbsp;</li><li>Need to have capability where only creator can issue badge.

Tumblr and blogs allow for this.</li><li>Scheduling for different timezones - using external tools to schedule stuff, is there way to integrate?</li><li>P2PU course running on a dif platform - how can we still be part of P2PU and&#x2F;or School of Open but point people else where for the actual course? eg. handle sign-up and initial course communication via P2PU but would be more of a splash page that goes somewhere else. Right now with disqus and everything - it confuses people where the course is running, even if we try to make clear in text.</li><li>Announcements - no history of sent messages. ability to look back on what we sent to who. currently an empty box you type into.. don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going, how it&#x27;s formatted, what the &quot;from&quot; or &quot;subject&quot; field will look like.<ul class="bullet"><li>The fact that the #hashtag field in &quot;Settings&quot; feeds into the subject line&nbsp; of &quot;Announcements&quot; is not obvious. What else does it do? We would prefer to have the course name (without a #, and with the ability to use spaces) in the subject line -- or, ideally, just generic control over the subject line. Agreed: 20 characters makes for a very short subject line, and not being able to use spaces is tricky.</li><li>Accounting for people who sign up after we send out initial announcement? Maybe announcement could have ability to auto-send a customized greeting to new students when they enroll.</li></ul></li><li>Email addresses are the only way that makes sense -- so how to get them as&nbsp; course facilitators while abiding by privacy policy, etc. - as new students sign up as well. Do we go through Dirk each and every time?<ul class="bullet"><li>Also - with emails we have no username&#x2F;identity to attach to them the current way we get them. Would be good to have a list of the course participants.</li></ul></li><li>People page - the main piece of information facilitators seek is the username and total enrollment number. How to make these clear.&nbsp;</li><li>Not quite clear what it means to &quot;Follow&quot; someone or to be &quot;Followed&quot;.</li><li>Brief explanations around certain form fields - Confused&nbsp; by non-English on the Settings page - Gearchiveerd, Gesloten? Also not&nbsp; sure what &quot;rolling term&quot; means in this context - perhaps some text to&nbsp; clarify? Same with most metadata fields- perhaps a brief explanation of&nbsp; what these terms mean and how the data will be used.</li><li>Text editing<ul class="bullet"><li>Markup isn&#x27;t entirely intuitive for newbies. Can we have some notes for people or a preface with tips? Didn&#x27;t&nbsp; realize for a while that moving text around while editing text wouldn&#x27;t&nbsp; automatically update the footnote order - so ended up with wrong&nbsp; citations attached to text during course development. Perhaps a note to users to this effect.</li><li>An edit button at the top as well as bottom of each page would be greatly&nbsp; appreciated, for work on longer pages requring extensive edits.</li><li>If the &quot;Start Course&quot; button were visible in the first screen it would not&nbsp; be necessary to add a sentence explaining to people where to click to&nbsp; sign up for the course.</li></ul></li><li>Titles in the course boxes get cut off -- would be nice if it didn&#x27;t!</li><li>P2PU doesn&#x27;t work with older versions explorer. Make sure course ux works in all standard browsers - not just Chrome and Firefox (the open ones).</li><li>Interface doesn&#x27;t make it clear what will happen with future ux or tools. eg. the challenge ux just went away</li><li>Course support toolkit or resource - Allison had developed one (or several) but can&#x27;t find it after searches through old wiki and archive.p2pu.org.

This is really important from our perspective; like many SOO&nbsp; topics, we have an issue of &quot;a platform within a platform within a&nbsp; platform&quot; which leads to very complex screens full of information that&nbsp; is not all directly relevant to the student, and removing extraneous&nbsp; discussion options will go a long way toward helping us create a&nbsp; cleaner, more comprehensible user experience. (Pete F&#x2F;Writing Wikipedia Articles class)<ul class="bullet"><li>Specific to Wikipedia - but would also be common to courses that might use a dif platform, or use various open platforms</li></ul></li><li>No revision history for course pages. Can&#x27;t see history of course pages, view diffs, determine who did what. Not possible to collaborate effectively on building a course without being able to see one another&#x27;s changes.</li><li>(related to above) No archive system for SOO pages within a course. We would like to be able to <strong>archive</strong> the 6 or 8 pages that we are retiring, in case we want to refer back to them, instead of <strong>deleting</strong> them. We&#x27;ve worked around it by pasting the markdown and the rendered pages into a Google Doc, but this is a bit cumbersome. (Pete F&#x2F;riting Wikipedia Articles class)</li><li>Related: would be nice to simply deactivate&#x2F;disable (&quot;un-publish&quot;) pages instead of deleting them.</li><li>Any facilitated course with synchronous sessions will face this issue:&nbsp; how to present class dates and times to students in many time zones, and&nbsp; (depending on the time of year) in countries with varying Daylight&nbsp; Savings&#x2F;Summer Time policies?<ul class="bullet"><li>External tool - We managed to present it reasonably well, I think, on Wikipedia, by using a template that references timeanddate.com. The first column in this table shows how we handled it: <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;en&#x2e;wikipedia&#x2e;org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index&#x2e;php&#x3f;title&#x3d;Wikipedia&#x3a;Communicate&#x5f;OER&#x5f;SOO&#x5f;Course&amp;oldid&#x3d;552613388">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Wikipedia:Communicate_OER_SOO_Course&amp;oldid=552613388</a></li></ul></li><li>Letting people list courses on P2PU (and as part of P2PU) that are&nbsp; hosted elsewhere. The course would just be a splashpage that points people elsewhere. Or we could still handle sign-up through P2PU (so course organizers have&nbsp; some way of managing communication with those who join their course).&nbsp;</li><li>Disqus contributes to a sense of fragmentation - not really attached to P2PU. If you have chosen to handle discussion in a different way (as more than one course die), Disqus is just another channel that you have to monitor, and you don&#x27;t have much control over how it works. Really not a fan of Disqus. At minimum, it should be possible to turn it off as a course setting, and&#x2F;or on each page. Putting a custom message at the top of the &quot;Discussion&quot; tab explaining how the feature will or won&#x27;t be used in the course would be a big help, as well. be able to turn it on and off</li><li>I personally found having to login to Disqus separately each time a barrier to using it and assume others experienced it the same way.</li><li>Announcements - no history of sent messages. archive? empty box you type into.. don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s going, how it&#x27;s formatted, what the &quot;from&quot; or &quot;subject&quot; field will look like.<ul class="bullet"><li>The fact that the #hashtag field in &quot;Settings&quot; feeds into the subject line of &quot;Announcements&quot; is not obvious. What else does it do? We would prefer to have the course name (without a #, and with the ability to use spaces) in the subject line -- or, ideally, just generic control over the subject line. Agreed: 20 characters makes for a very short subject line, and not being able to use spaces is tricky.</li><li>Announcements should have a checkbox: &quot;Auto-send to new students when they enroll.&quot; Without a feature like that, we have a tricky situation: we want to greet people early, but this means that people who enroll later miss the greeting.</li><li>When people sign up after announcements - how do we contact them</li><li>Might require a level of investment that might not be possible.&nbsp;</li><li>When people sign up - way for them to get automatic message</li></ul></li><li>Email addresses are the only way that makes sense -- so how to get them as course facilitators while abiding by privacy policy, etc. - as new students sign up as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Losing people with each additional communication tool</li><li>When reviewing the People page as facilitator, the main piece of information I seek is the username - not the photo, &quot;make organizer&quot; or &quot;remove user&quot; buttons.
