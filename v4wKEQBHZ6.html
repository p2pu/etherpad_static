<body><strong>A few basic principles for P2PU compensation and hiring</strong><br><br>&#8211; Draft version for feedback --<br><br>[Please note that this draft version was developed with input from a few board members to summarize ideas around good compensation practices at P2PU. It has not gone through legal review, hasn&#x27;t received community input, and is not an official policy or guideline for P2PU.]<br><br>The key to success for P2PU is to have good and happy people in the community. Paid staff members are an important part of the community, and while compensation is only one of the motivating factors for P2PU staff, it is an important one. That&#x27;s why we strive to be fair and transparent regarding our compensation practices, and involve the broader community in the process.<br><br>Principles:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>P2PU is built on flat structures and hierarchies, and this applies to compensation differentials as well.</li><li>We strive for equal and fair treatment of all staff, while taking into account and making affordances for individual differences and preferences.</li><li>The community can give input to the hiring process, helping shape the paid positions required, and finding the right people to fill them.</li></ul><br>Operational:<br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>We adjust our compensation levels based on the market rate at similar non-profit organizations, located in the US, and working in the open and education space.</li><li>Staff and contractors working at the same level (defined by responsibilities, expertise, experience) receive the same compensation, in terms of cost to the organization.&nbsp;</li><li>The highest paid person at P2PU makes no more than twice the salary of the lowest paid staff member.</li><li>We don&#x27;t take into account the physical location of our staff. Even though cost of living in some countries may be higher, usually these countries also offer more benefits &#8211; such as security, access to quality health and education services, etc.</li><li>We accomodate individuals that prefer a stable employment relationship with benefits, as well as those who prefer the increased freedom and flexibility of contract work.</li><li>Job descriptions are posted to the community list for feedback before we fill positions. Community members (and board members as needed) can participate in interviews and the hiring process.</li><li>P2PU needs to raise funds to sustain its operations. We reward funding acquisitions through bonus payments over and above the agreed salaries.</li></ul><br></body>
