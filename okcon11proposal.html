<body><strong>Workshop planning</strong><br><br>The original proposal&nbsp; (below) included speed geeking for the first 20-25 minutes&nbsp; and then breaking up into smaller how-to groups for a half hour of question asking and planning.<br><br>I suggest that we have a call to run through the speedgeek presentations and to discuss the goals of the breakout sessions.<br><br><strong>SPEEDGEEKS</strong><br><br>The topics we proposed to discuss in the speedgeek were:&nbsp;<br><ul class="bullet"><li>open governance model</li><li>P2PU and the Open Education community</li><li>the School of Webcraft partnership with Mozilla Foundation (and other schools)</li><li>the P2PU peer-learning model&nbsp;</li><li>P2PU as a research space.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>Given that there&#x27;ll be 4 &#x2F; 5 people participating that makes for a good&nbsp; speed geek rotation. The one problem will be that it will be difficult&nbsp; to facilitate &#x2F; timekeep the speed geeking if all of you are acting as&nbsp; the presenters.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Nominate the topic you&#x27;d like to present in the speed geek:</em></strong><br><br>Charlie: the p2pu peer-learning model<br>Niels: Rogue courses and the potential of P2PUs curriculum to adapt to a changing world and cater to individual skills faster and better than traditional unis. I can relate this to &#x27;open governance&#x27; or &#x27;P2PU and the open education community&#x27; or maybe add &#x27;the value of p2pu in the educational landscape&#x27; to the speedgeeks<br>Bekka: The Open Governance model - how do we actually manage to keep this boat afloat?<br><br>- Remember you&#x27;ll have to talk for 4 minutes on this topic 4 or 5 times over! If you can share slides on a laptop at the same time that will be really useful too.<br><br>-----------<br><br><strong>BREAK OUT SESSIONS</strong><br>For the&nbsp; breakouts it would be great to frame the work as &quot;Create A&nbsp; Course or Group in 30 minutes&quot; &quot;Identify Potential Schools and Plan Their First&nbsp; Steps in 30 minutes)&quot; .<br><br>Way back when I first joined SoW John Britton and I ran a speedgeek and&nbsp; break out sessions at the Mozilla Summit. The Create a Course session&nbsp; was particularly successful, so I&#x27;d suggest potentially offering two&nbsp; groups for that.<br><br>It would be a good idea for these sessions to hand out some kind of worksheet. I think that if we produce a useful worksheet for creating a course or group we&#x27;ll have a very valuable resource that can be reused in different contexts.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong><em>Nominate the Break Out session you&#x27;d like to facilitate:</em></strong><br>Charlie: &quot;Create A&nbsp; Course or Group in 30 minutes<br>Niels: Create a rogue course<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>OKCon Workshop</strong><br><br>P2PU: Open Community Learning on the Web, Create a course, a school, or a whole university in 60 minutes<br><br><strong>Our website: </strong><a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;new&#x2e;p2pu&#x2e;org">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.p2pu.org</a><br><br><strong>Abstract</strong><br><br>Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is moving towards its second anniversary. Within the last year we have formalised the project as a non-profit organisation practising open governance; taken on employees; introduced peer-based assessment and badges; partnered with external organisations to provide curated Schools and continued to grow our community. This workshop will present perspectives on the project from key staff, school representatives (Webcraft and Mathematical Futures) and researchers and invite anyone to join us in building the higher education system of the future. Bring your whiteboards, labcoats, gym outfits.<br><br><br><strong>Agenda</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>5 minutes - Welcome&#x2F; Intro</li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li>20 minutes - We will &quot;speed-geek&quot; through short presentations about different aspects of P2PU</li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li>30 minutes - The&nbsp; remaining time of the workshop will be spent in collaborative small groups working on research opportunities, course ideas, proposals for schools, partnership strategies - and generally geeking out on the future of higher education (and building it).

He&#x27;s been producing OER for over two years and is currently managing an educational start-up (<a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;mr&#x2e;danoff&#x2e;org&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mr.danoff.org)</a> searching for a space to make money online while publishing very high-quality OER.</li></ul><br>Rebecca Kahn<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Bekka Kahn is Community Manager at P2PU. She ran a course on Cyberpunk Literature in the pilot in which she knew less than the participants, and learnt more in 6 weeks than an entire undergrad literature degree. She is currently completing an MA on digital repositories and libraries at King&#x27;s Collge, London.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>Philipp Schmidt<br><ul class="bullet"><li>(Jan) Philipp Schmidt is executive director and co-founder of the Peer 2 Peer University. He is an open education activist&#x2F;researcher, has managed open ed projects at the University of the Western Cape, and the United Nations University MERIT, and is a board member of the OpenCourseWare Consortium.

The pilot &#x27;09 course Poker and Strategic Thinking played with the boundaries of academic subjects and explored the value of ideas in the on- and offline poker communities for academia. The second-cycle course Kitchen Science was designed as a peer learning experience, where the aim of the organiser was to facilitate a group of people going through MIT OCW OER together.&nbsp;</li></ul><br></body>
