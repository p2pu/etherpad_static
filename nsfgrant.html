During a series of challenges learners will use programming skills to create artifacts such as games, video tutorials etc. Meanwhile there will be opportunities for them to meet offline through School of Games - Jams.<br><br>The project will be two fold: on one side we will suggest an online community (with some offline potential as well) that learns how to progam and design games, on the other side we will collect data from this and do evaluation.<br><br>Bigger Vision ok (games + programming)<br>What we need to make clear &gt;&nbsp;<br><br>1) CURRICULUM: What course will be in the school of games and what kids of competencies will be in the school of games.&nbsp;<br><br>2) FEATURES: What tools will we be using, what programming languages we will promote, logistics of how it would work. They will especially want to know what types of computational skills we want to teach.<br><br>Audience &gt; for the NSF grant there are teachers but also broader audiences. For us makes sense to focus on college, young adults &gt; goal to increase their computational thinking.<br><br>CE21 Goals<br>Need to map clearly to the goals of the CE21 program:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Increase the number and diversity of K-14 students and teachers who develop and practice computational competencies in a variety of contexts; and</li><li>Increase the number and diversity of early postsecondary students who are engaged and have the background in computing necessary to successfully pursue degrees in computing-related and computationally-intensive fields of study.</li><li>CE21 aims to do that by &quot;promoting and enhancing <strong>computing K-14 education</strong>, the CE21 program seeks to increase <strong>interest in computing as a field in its own right</strong>, and also to better prepare students for <strong>successful careers in other computing-intensive fields</strong>.&quot;</li></ul><br>Problem CE21 is trying to solve:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>&quot;Most of today&#x27;s high schools do not offer any rigorous computing classes appropriate for college-bound students; few high school computing teachers have a formal background in computing; and little is being done to engage the majority of our students who show no interest in IT careers.&quot;</li></ul><br>Constraints:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>Focus has to be on K-14 computing education - School of Games might be &quot;too far out&quot;</li><li>&quot;the CE21 program focuses special attention on activities targeted at the middle and high school levels (i.e., secondary education) and in early undergraduate education.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The CE21 program especially encourages proposals that align with, and promise to contribute to, the success of the NSF-initiated CS 10K Project. (See <a href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;www&#x2e;computingportal&#x2e;org&#x2F;cs10k&#x29;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computingportal.org&#x2F;cs10k)</a> CS 10K aims to increase the effectiveness of computing education in high school through the introduction of an entirely new curriculum (based on a proposed, new Advanced Placement course) concomitant with the preparation of 10,000 high school teachers prepared to teach the new curriculum in 10,000 schools by 2015.&quot;<ul class="bullet"><li>Question for NSF -&gt; Would they be happy with a mostly online &#x2F; less formal approach?</li><li>Question for NSF -&gt; Does a series of &quot;courses&#x2F;challenges&quot; qualify as &quot;curriculum&quot;?</li><li>Question for NSF -&gt; Does CS 10k mean we need to include teacher PD materials? A: No, but could focus on either curriculum or PD</li></ul></li><li>&quot;Project teams must include faculty members with expertise in the core computing disciplines <strong>and </strong>researchers in the education and&#x2F;or learning disciplines; in most cases, it will also be necessary to include individuals with expertise in issues of underrepresentation.&quot;</li><li>&quot;The CE21 program also seeks proposals that describe alternative models for delivering middle and high school curricula, such as (but not limited to) senior level high school courses (that meet state-wide math or science requirements), dual credit courses (to be taken simultaneously for secondary school and college credit), or online and distance learning activities.&quot;<ul class="bullet"><li>Questions -&gt; Is School of Games sufficiently connected into formal education? How can it be affiliated with a more formal institution?&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>Added section on partnership further below</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>NSF has a requirement for &quot;broader impact&quot; - proposals needs to, in some way, clearly serve <u>under-served</u> populations<ul class="bullet"><li>Curriculum and learning opportunities widely available (to anyone), but clear partnerships to specifically target under-served communities. For example &quot;girls&#x2F;women&quot; in tech - work with existing networks &#x2F; communities</li><li>Mozilla &#x2F; Hive NYC - connect with community projects and spaces that work with underserved populations<ul class="bullet"><li>Dreamyard (Bronx)</li><li>Ladies learning code</li><li>Queen Mary University London (not US)</li><li>YouMedia spaces (Nichole Pinkard, Chicago)<ul class="bullet"><li>May have to include a local &quot;animator&quot; &#x2F; &quot;trainer&quot; to support</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br>Thoughts:<br><ul class="bullet"><li>We could make an argument that &quot;computer games&quot; are a way to draw people into CS that would otherwise not want to develop computer science competencies. The end-goal would not only be to develop a community of game developers (although that would be nice) but to &quot;increase the number and diversity of students who develop computational competencies&quot;</li><li>Need to clearly explain what *computational* competencies users at School of Games would develop</li><li>Can we tie School of Games clearly to high-schools? It sounds like we&#x27;d have to have a link to at least one high school, and relate what we do to existing (or new) high school curriculum.&nbsp;<ul class="bullet"><li>q2l is not a high school yet (it will be next year though)</li><li>They also build their own curriculum as they go &#x2F; may not be interested in collaborating on curriculum development. Maybe willing to be a project partner anyway, for certification? Chloe to follow up</li></ul></li></ul><br>Type of Grant &#x2F; I think we could consider a planning proposal (&gt;200k) or Type I grant (&gt;1M)<br><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>&quot;Type I</strong> proposals, in the aggregate, focus on activities that build the research base on the effective teaching and learning of computing, draw on partnerships of informed and committed stakeholders, and create and study the effectiveness of new instructional materials and interventions and&#x2F;or strategies to develop K-14 teaching expertise in computing. Type I projects may conduct basic research on learning, or design, develop, test, validate, and refine materials, measurement tools, and methods for teaching and learning in specific contexts, and&#x2F;or they may implement promising smaller-scale interventions in order to study their efficacy with particular groups. Type I projects will be funded at levels of up to $1 million for up to three years.&quot;<ul class="bullet"><li>Finally this may cover the vision we have been discussing</li><li>Reviewers will be looking for track records, and indication that we will deliver</li><li>Play up the work we have all done (UoU, P2PU, Q2L, working with Mozilla, teacher PD, etc.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Planning </strong>proposals seek to build the new partnerships and collaborations needed to design and develop Type I or Type II projects. They will be funded at levels up to $200,000 for up to 18 months. PIs interested in submitting a planning grant should first contact a cognizant program officer.<ul class="bullet"><li>Programme Officers and Reviewers will allow more flexibility</li><li>But 200k is not a lot of money, so doubtful to produce real results with a large network of partners</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>PROJECT SUMMARY</strong><br><br>Peer to Peer University and University of Maryland (ok to include UoM, June?) propose to bring together youth and digital game experts in an online community dedicated to learning how to design and develop digital and non digital games.<br><br>The community will come together online by joining a &quot;School of Games&quot; in the Peer to Peer University platform as well as offline by participating in local &quot;School of Games Jams&quot;.
