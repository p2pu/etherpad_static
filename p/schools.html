<body><strong>Discussion</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Agreeements<ul class="bullet"><li>What do we want to get out of these agreements -&gt; overall goals for these agreements (recap of conversation yesterday)</li><li>AB: For now - focus on agreements between organizations</li><li>DB: Make sure the agreement represents a commitment and its enforceable</li></ul></li><li>Given that P2PU itself is a community - how do we infuse that into the design of partnerships for schools? How do we manage input into <u>community norms</u> of schools and make sure they stay on track with our vision?<ul class="bullet"><li>What is our community? Can we help the schools with learning or content expertise?&nbsp;</li><li>Include values in partnership agreements</li></ul></li><li>Goals for trademarks<ul class="bullet"><li>Protect the name of a school - and the values that are underlying the school</li><li>Build the P2PU brand</li><li>There is some value attached to the name</li><li>Who invests more time and effort into a school to make it work?<ul class="bullet"><li>Philipp: Based on experience with existing schools, it has to be the partner or the school won&#x27;t work. School of Maths. School of SoSI. School of Webcraft.</li><li>Yes, and I also think that most &quot;Schools&quot; probably do <u>not</u> need to be TMed. It really depends on whether we imagine the School growing into a sufficiently large community which would benefit from greater certainty regarding the core values of that School.</li><li>PS: Do you see our key role as the guardian of the &quot;values&quot;? (e.g. open, community, peer-learning) AB: Yes, I do. Keep it at a high level.</li><li>AB: By the way, if we called all of the various schools &quot;P2PU School of....&quot;, then no additional trademark would probably be needed.<ul class="bullet"><li>That brings us back to that discussion ;-) Is it the P2PU School of Data or the OKFN School of Data or the OKFN&#x2F;P2PU School of Data?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Do we want to own the trademarks for schools?<ul class="bullet"><li>1000 USD &#x2F; trademark and it&#x27;s work setting it up</li><li>Ahrash: I think we should have more ownership over schools structures -&gt; own the trademark.</li><li>Nadeem: Relationship betwen P2PU and partners needs to be formalized and we should own trademarks. If it is not formalized, there is a chance that we get lost in the narrative. For example badges. CNXCON discussion no mention of P2PU.&nbsp;</li><li>Delia: Badges example is demonstrating some of the issues. Yes to ownership of trademarks</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What do we need to add to the charter documents to make them complete partnership agreements?</li><li>Partnerships - Schools - Sustainability: Ahrash has a poor sense how some of the decisions around partnership and schools development are playing into the broader sustainability question. We have talked off and on, whether or not schools as a construct provide a path to sustainability, and what does that mean? How do schools bring in income? Would like to see the link back to sustainability.&nbsp;</li></ul><br><strong>What are the broad roles overall?&nbsp;</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>P2PU:<ul class="bullet"><li>Learning</li><li>Platform</li><li>Models of facilitation</li><li>Assessment</li><li>Alternative certification</li></ul></li></ul><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Partners &#x2F; What we look for in our partners:<ul class="bullet"><li>Content expertise</li><li>Community leadership in the content area of the school</li><li>Authoritative voice in their community</li><li>Large networks and reach to attract users</li></ul></li></ul><br><strong>Partnership Development Process</strong><br><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Likely to start as informal collaboration.&nbsp;</li><li>At the point that P2PU makes a commitment to providing resources to support the partnership, an agreement is put in place</li></ul><br><strong>Draft Agreement</strong><br><br>Schools are joint projects between P2PU and another organization or group.
