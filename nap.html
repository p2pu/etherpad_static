20 people in budget)<br>-- semantic analysis of textual data<br><br>Deliverables<br>- milestone 1, Oct 30 2012<br>-- preliminary focus groups, site analytic data based on usage in winter semester 2012 in two depts<br><br><strong><u>brainstorming:</u></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>platforms it&#x27;s natural to compare ourselves with&#x2F;integrate with:<br>- academia (pubs written yourself)<br>- facebook (friending, walls, groups, sharing)<br>- twitter&#x2F;google plus (following, sharing with circles)<br>- blogger (expressing yourself long form - Clare Brett&#x27;s research on graduate student communities using blogs)<br>- mendeley (papers I&#x27;ve read, citations I&#x27;ve collected)<br>- the anti-calendar (what did I think about this class - stuff the professor doesn&#x27;t want you to know)<br>- the portal (replacement for Blackboard during a course)<br>- intranet (information from the department, news updates, etc)<br>- goodreads (books I&#x27;ve read)<br>- Wikipedia&#x2F;other wikis (collaborative knowledge - either meta, about the department&#x2F;major, or discipline specific - best books for a certain period, research methods etc)<br>- student newspaper<br><br>what can individual users share<br>- status updates<br>- reflective writing (bloglike)<br>- books&#x2F;articles they are reading (for class&#x2F;not for class)<br>- courses they are taking (automatic?)<br>- personal profiles, descriptions<br>- tags<br>- class projects<br>-- texts<br>-- multimedia objects<br>- news articles, links<br><br>levels of sharing<br>- private to each student<br>- only members of the same course<br>- all UofT students&#x2F;profs on the platform (distinguish students&#x2F;profs?)<br>- the whole world<br><br>axis of communication<br>- student to student<br>-- students find each other through tags, joint courses etc<br>-- &quot;friend&quot;

publications from Academia, T-Space<br><br>issues to consider<br>- participation of professors&#x2F;TAs<br>-- on the one hand, many undergrads want more access to their professors etc<br>-- on the other hand, it can stifle dialogue, change communication from honest questions to &quot;posturing&quot;, make students feel like they have to participate to get good marks (a chore) etc<br>-- (and we don&#x27;t know if profs would actually take time to be active in the system in the first place)<br>- openness and privacy of information<br>-- there might be good reasons for all levels of privacy, at the same time it should not be complicated or impose a cognitive load when posting something, and it should also be perceived as reliable and trustworthy (as opposed to Facebook)<br>- longevity of forum - students might be reluctant in investing a lot in a forum that might not last (given many other attempts at student websites etc)<br>- what will drive participation<br>- what is minimum valuable product, especially for use in a few classes this fall?&nbsp;<br><br></body>
