<body>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tainos were people in the West Indies who lived in villages, grew corn, yams, and cotton, and were generous to the Spanish. They were taken advantage of by the conquistadors who seized all of their gold jewelry and decorations. They were also pressured by Christians to convert to Christianity. They were also made sick by diseases such as small pox, measles, and the flu, which were brought to the Americas by the Europeans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hernan Cortes was an early conquistador who landed on the coast of Mexico in 1519. Cortes worked with a translator who told him that if he could form alliances with the people conquered by the Aztecs then he could overpower the Aztecs. The Spanish did not overpower the Aztecs but Moctezuma was killed in the fighting. Then Cortes decided to attack again and this time with Montezuma dead he overpowered them and took Tenochtitlan. He served as an inspiration to other explorers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malinche was an Indian woman who was a translator and advisor to Cortes. She is also known as Dona Marina to the Spanish. She was fluent in the Mayan and Aztec languages and picked up Spanish quickly as well. She told Cortes that the Aztec&#8217;s conquered peoples despised the Aztecs and helped Cortes form alliances with the conquered people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moctezuma was an Aztec emperor who welcomed Cortes only to find out that Cortes had motives that were not beneficial to him. He led the Aztecs to drive out the Spanish. They succeeded at removing the Spanish from Tenochtitlan but Moctezuma was killed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Francisco Pizarro was an explorer who travelled to Peru in 1532. This was just following Atahualpa&#8217;s ascension to the throne after he prevailed over his brother in a civil war. Pizarro with help from Indian allies captured Atahualpa. The Spanish promised to release him for a large sum of money but they made bad on their promise and after the Incans had paid they killed him. The Spanish conquered the Incans despite their tenacity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atahualpa was the Incan king who was captured by Pizarro after he won his title by overpowering his own brother in a civil war. The Spanish then killed him.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A conquistador is a Spanish conqueror. The conquistadors came to the Americas after Columbus for the same three reasons many other explorers travelled to foreign lands: God, glory, and gold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immunity means resistance. This is often used when talking about illnesses or politics. In the case of this chapter immunity is the resistance of disease. The Native Americans had no immunity to the diseases brought over by the Europeans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An alliance is an agreement between two or more powers to cooperate and defend each other. The people conquered by the Aztecs formed an alliance with the Spanish to help overpower the Aztecs. Indian allies of the Spanish also helped Pizarro conquered the Incans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A civil war is a war between two groups of the same nation. The Incans fought a bloody civil war in which the brother of Atahualpa was killed and Atahualpa took control.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Europeans took advantage of the Native Americans of the Caribbean. The Europeans took their jewelry and made them pan for more gold, basically they did slave labor, and the Christians also tried to convert the people, and gave the natives diseases such as small pox and measles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pizarro conquered the Incans by forming alliances with other Indians and slaughtered many of Atahualpa&#8217;s followers before they got to Atahualpa himself. Once they killed Atahualpa they continued to fight the Incans until they had complete control over the Incans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spanish Domination<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The divisions within the Aztec and Incan empires helped the Spanish because the Spanish became allied with Indians within the empires that did not support the empire such as conquered peoples; they then used these rivals to fight the empire and got much of their manpower from the rebels or rival tribes. They also became allied with other Indian tribes that were known to be rivals with their target tribe and used them to take the tribe out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other reasons for the Spanish domination include the diseases that the Europeans spread throughout the Americas, the weaponry that the Spaniards had access to such as muskets and cannons to attack and helmets and armor to protect. They also imported horses, which many Indians were afraid of since they had no horses. The last reason for the rapid Spanish domination is that the Indians by large believed that the disasters were signs that the end of the world was approaching so they really didn&#8217;t try to fight the Gods.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spanish conquest of the Americas was similar to that of the crusades because both situations involved European Christians spreading their religion into areas outside of Europe. They both used force to do so and killed people who did not agree with them. The Europeans both demolished beloved landmarks, Tenochtitlan and Babylon. They also used non-Europeans against the group they were trying to drive out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some differences include the forces behind each take over; in the Crusades it was Alexius I of Byzantine who called for help and the Pope who answered while in the Spanish domination it was work of explorers. The main drive for the crusades was to heal the split between Byzantine and the Roman church and also to stop the fighting among Europeans by introducing a common enemy while the motive in the Americas was to conquer land and wealth. One was political, Crusades, while the other was not concerning politics, Americas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The relationship between the Spanish and the natives began as a peaceful one between an advanced nation and a less advanced one.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The conquistadors began to take over the natives land and control their spiritual beliefs and worldly possessions through force.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Diseases introduced by the Europeans began to wipe out the natives and their population decreased by about 90 percent.<br></body>
